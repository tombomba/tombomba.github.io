Randolph Scott plays bandits off against one another in a small Arizona town just after the Civil War. It's almost a proto-"Fistful of Dollars." Almost. Director Andr√© de Toth delivers his usual flair on an obviously low budget, staging action sequences with a good, dangerous energy. But then characters are never much more than archetypes lashed to the plot, their dialogue perfunctory and expected. A promising opening sequence, where Scott helps Southern outlaws sack a city, awkwardly connects to the rest of the story. Small events and whole conversations are sometimes referenced but not depicted, as if pages were lost or a reel went missing. Claire Trevor breathes real life into the otherwise thankless role of love interest. Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin do what they do, but they also did it better elsewhere.
