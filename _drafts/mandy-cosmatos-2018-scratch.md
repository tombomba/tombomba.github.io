"Mandy" is a technicolor geek show. We pays our money and we takes our chances to see Nicolas Cage, fanboy favorite and former actor, bite the head off a cinematic chicken. It's trash-action, a gonzo wannabe. Colorful, kooky, and---at least for the first half---languid. It succeeds as the antithesis to corporate junk playing elsewhere at the multiplex, but not on its own, as, ya know, _a movie._

It left me wondering if Cage has paid back the I.R.S. If he has, then why does he choose these projects? If he hasn't,  how much farther does he have to go? Each time out, his audience doesn't watch a film as much as donate to the cause. Making Cage whole with the federal government, 9 dollars a time.

The film's barker is Cosmatos, who also wrote and directed the dream-infused "Beyond the Black Rainbow."

- I was never sure if I was meant to laugh _at_ it or _with_ it or whether I was meant to be laughing at all.

- I enjoyed bits and pieces of this and it certainly was an [I]experience[/I]. I woulda enjoyed it more if Cosmatos' ego wasn't so fucking big. (2 hours? Really, dude?)

- Agree with Spinal that the first part is better than the second .

- The first part is emotionally languid and visually kooky. That's enough to hold me for awhile. But the second part has half the creative energy. The images are noticeably less thoughtful. The fight scenes are under-choreographed. It plays like a cut rate Rambo movie starring Van Damme's third stunt double.

- I disagree about the movie's core problem: It isn't that the beats are expected.  It's a revenge movie and everybody knows it, I think, going in. (Beyond that, the movie is a technicolor geek show. We wanna see Cage bite the head off the proverbial chicken.)

- I think the bigger issue is that it's narratively incoherent (how does Cage find everyone so easily?), it skates by on genre tropes to fill gaps in the story (Bill Duke's  brief, half-written scene as the Provider of Weapons and Teller of Backstory), and the characters are developed in the most perfunctory way (or, really, not at all, eg: the other cult members.)

- I found it hard to care beyond all the gee-whiz, stoner's-delight style images at the beginning. But I guess that makes it memorable, because it's far and away from the "television in a movie theater" corporate crap playing elsewhere in the multiplex.
