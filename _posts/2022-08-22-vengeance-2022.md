Written like an episode of a television show, the kind cancelled after half a season. The movie trucks in hoary clich√©s about country life and city folk, the humor is flat and uninspired, and the characters aren't developed beyond any one single punchline. 

Writer-director (and star!) B.J. Novak's Ben Manalowitz is too shallow; his decision to fly from New York to Texas for the funeral of an old fling unmotivated. Ben's subsequent choice to exploit the situation and turn her family's tragedy into a podcast is ghoulish and potentially funny, but the script is written low, constructed of lame jokes and punctuated with sitcom timing. 

For "Vengeance" to earn its payoff, the exe needed to be fully fleshed, so that as Ben learned about her and saw her humanity, so would the audience. Instead, we learn next to nothing. The dead girl exists primarily as the hook, the reason for him to be in Texas. Open questions about her only serve to push him through the story.

As Ben runs around talking to people and gathering material, he stays at the family home. They're all native Texans, all rendered as broad caricatures, and all stretched to the point of parody. The actors stuck with these roles behave as if they're trapped in a "Hee Haw" reboot by way of _Saturday Night Live._ (But with this sort of material. What else could they do?)

Novak and his fictional counterpart both prove they are more than willing to exploit regional stereotypes in the hopes of boosting their profile. Ben with his "Serial" style podcast, B.J. with this film. One of them comes to understand the error of his ways, and the other very clearly does not. Realizing this creates a weird dissonance, as the creation seems to have a glimmer more self-awareness than his creator.
