Gregory Peck wears a black hat in a western directed by William Wellman. A group of bank robbers cross the desert and discover an old man and a young girl living in a ghost town, and sitting on an abandoned fortune in gold. The outlaws decide they want a cut, but loyalties split early, as some of the men are more interested in the girl than the money. Faction lines are drawn and then narrow. Lotsa noir vibes, with the requisite shadows and without the glib dialogue. "Yellow Sky" is littered with grimy characters who wouldn't be out of place in the sorta film Anthony Mann would make years later, and those characters are played by actors who take the material from B picture to B plus. Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark, John Russell, and Harry Morgan make up the thieves, scheming against the old man, the girl, and each other. Anne Baxter shines as their match, bouncing a six gun on her hip and refusing to melt for anyone. Wellman shot on location, and there's some strong compositions among the high desert crags, as voices and gunfire reverberate with a hollow echo. Produced around the time of Ford's calvary trilogy and Hawk's "Red River," the movie looks clean and plays nasty, in a way strangely more contemporary than its peers.
