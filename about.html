_{{ site.title }}_ began years ago in an attempt to join what seemed a vital online conversaton. I work on it now in fits and starts. It is my thousand piece puzzle on the dining room table, my model ship in the den, my hand made canoe in the garage. 

My name is Tom Bomba. I once flirted with NYU's cinema studies program, then knocked around a few office jobs. These days I produce digital media. The words _filmic_ and _split diopter_ and _mise-en-scÃ¨ne_ make me cringe. I've only ever gone to the movies for the story.

The site's design is intentional, a form of nostalgia for the old web, and a standing reminder to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. The name is a loose reference to the work of Pauline Kael and Jeffrey Sconce. 

Sometimes, I listen to KCRW Los Angeles or KPISS.fm, and  carelessly, and I never know the singers or the names of the songs. But I enjoy the music. I've found there is a small pleasure in listening and not knowing.

There are quite a few critics online who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This website is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express ideas I don't see routinely expressed.

My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around NYU's cinema studies program before I "dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing various forms of digital media.

_{{ site.title }}_ is intentionally basic, the design a sorta mental note to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. The name is a loose reference to work by Pauline Kael and Jeffrey Sconce.

The site was built on an ancient Macintosh using VS Code and Pixelmator, while listening to KCRW Los&nbsp;Angeles.
