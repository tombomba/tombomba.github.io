"Across the globe and throughout time, I have stoked the fires of hungry appetites. And for it, I have become a soup of the people, a soup of honor, a soup of great fame."

Umami's ["The Cycle of Life"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uraG-z0grkc) is the strangest thing I've seen this year.

There are shades here of MTV's old ["Liquid Television"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mtv+liquid+television) and I will always have a soft spot for esoteric work that looks fast and cheap but isn't. With this, Umami intentionally clutters their video with audio pops and animated grain. The dialogue and the music is heavy, faux-profound, but played so straight it can't be anything but silly.

As for the message, the subtext, whatever this is saying---who the fuck knows? I'm not cool enough to get it, but I love it.
