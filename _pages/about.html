{% capture intro %}
There are quite a few crix out there who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This site is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express things I don't see routinely expressed.

{% capture bio %}
My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around NYU's cinema studies program before I "dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing digital media.

<i>{{ site.title }}</i> was created on a Macintosh using Jekyll, Atom, and Pixelmator while listening to KCRW Los Angeles.
