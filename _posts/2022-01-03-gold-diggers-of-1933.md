  "Gold Diggers of 1933" has the same kinda dizzy you might find in vaudeville, or low theater, or whatever it's called, those 18th century operas produced for the workaday stiffs, now made fresh with the moneyed sense of Old Hollywood and given over to a sorta art deco bohemianism.

A blueblood songwriter falls in love with a Broadway showgirl, but his family won't hear of it. His brother and uncle come around to stop the affair and protect the family interest. So the showgirl's friends, a trio of down and outers, decide to scam Mr Hoity and Mr Toity and run them out. And why not? If someone thinks you cheap and vulgar you might as well play the part and play them, too.

"Gold Diggers of 1933" (Warners, 1933) is rat-a-tat-tat witticisms, and rejoinder on top of rejoinder, with crazy plans and mad hijinks, and dancing, and then more hijinks. By the end it's a case of mistaken identity or two (you don't say), and confusion and revelation, and finally love all around and a smattering of proposals and (oh, what a surprise) happily-ever-after. It's a familiar story with familiar beats, with plenty of good jokes, and bookended by grand musical numbers staged by Busby Berekely.

"Gold Diggers" has the same kinda dizzy you might find in vaudeville, or low theater, or whatever it's called, those 18th century operas produced for the workaday stiffs, now made fresh with the moneyed sense of Old Hollywood and given over to a sorta art deco bohemianism. Everybody in this world is good looking and fashionable and well appointed, rich or poor.

I got the feeling the producers wanted to acknowledge the social ill of the Great Depression and thought the best way to do it was to pile on as much sex and glamour as one movie could stand. So the result is this always entertaining entertainment, but strange in a way, too. A picture where the young and the beautiful make jokes about not having enough to eat, or sing songs about forgotten veterans on the breadline, and do it while wearing a hat that cost more than a month of working class wages.
