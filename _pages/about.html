{% capture bio %}
Originally, I wanted a movie site in answer to those shilly fan blogs. Then maybe a more general arts and culture thing, akin to a _Hyperallergic_ or _Elephant._ Or, I thought, a media diary. Sorta amateur _K-Punk,_ written for the uninitiated. Short and quick, spun out into more and more tangents. Digital life, analog westerns, old novels, new science fiction, dead journalism, 8-bit games, indie art... Simply talk about what was good when it was good, what's meaningful now.
