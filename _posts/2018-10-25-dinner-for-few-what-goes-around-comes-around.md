Nassos Vakalis' ["Dinner for Few"](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/nassos-vakalis-dinner-for-few-animation-190918) is a bald political allegory and a good one. The film begins at dilapidated seaside hotel during a storm. Inside, a sounder of pigs, each of them walking upright and wearing formal attire, gather around a table for dinner. A manservant works an odd machine; he shovels raw materials into one end and fresh food comes out the other. Below, a clowder of cats fight over scraps. As the pigs become more voracious, the cats more aggressive. What happens when there's nothing left to eat?

"Dinner for Few" isn't a traditional narrative. The characters are symbols, the conflict obvious, and there is no dialogue. The music and foley effects set my teeth on edge and the visuals repulsed me. Yet I couldn't take my eyes off it. It has all the trappings of a good horror film but in a 10 minute cartoon. The tension builds and Vakalis dips lightly into surreal fantasy, and he delivers a payoff that is cynical without being nihilistic. "Dinner for Few" is equal parts grotesque, beautiful, and troubling.
