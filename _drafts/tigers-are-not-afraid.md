The film, produced in Mexico, and originally "Vuelven" (literally "They Return"), centers on two children living in a ghost town created by narco violence. El Shine leads a group of street kids, imagining himself a gang leader but behaving more as a tiny parent. He and his pals steal whatever they need and sleep wherever they can find a squat. Estrella is quite literally haunted by victims of the local cartel, and befriends Shine after she is orphaned. The opening introduces a main plot and a couple subplots, which automatically makes the film more ambitious than most.

Unfortunately, "Tigers Are Not Afraid" never becomes greater than the sum of its parts. Shine pickpockets a cartel goon, which leads to obvious problems. The bad guys are stock movie thugs (albeit ones who often point guns at small children). The supernatural elements plaguing Estrella are mostly spooky voices and desiccated corpses, heightened by the occasionally strong visual. It's standard stuff, really, and curiously separate from the rest of the film; nobody else realizes she can see and hear the dead.

The larger problem lies in concept and execution. "Tigers" attempts light fantasy crossed with overt brutality. The fantasy is too light, having no effect on the main story. The brutality is too graphic, with close-ups of shootings and stabbings, and hard violence involving little kids. I'm old enough to remember when a film like "Tigers Are Not Afraid" would have been considered in poor taste, if not highly manipulative. Because the reality of the film, the subject of cartel kidnapping and murder, is far too ugly to be addressed this way, with whimsical animations, imagined revenge, and, my God, an upbeat ending.
