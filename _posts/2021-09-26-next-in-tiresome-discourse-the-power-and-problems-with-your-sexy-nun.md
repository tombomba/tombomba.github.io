title: "Next in tiresome discourse: The power and problems with your sexy nun movie"

Too many contemporary critics are smug when they should be thoughtful. Case in point: The [film twit reaction](https://twitter.com/search?q=benedetta%20protest&src=typed_query) to a small protest outside the NYFF showing of "Benedetta," Paul Verhoeven's [lesbian nun movie](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=verhoeven+benedetta+trailer).

A dozen Catholics from a right-leaning fringe group made noise this Sunday afternoon. Right outside a movie theater. There were bagpipes, and a snare drum. One guy carried a megaphone. A sign read, "Why the endless insults to Jesus?" Another, "I'm Catholic. Stop attacking my faith."

First, who cares? It was an insignificant rally, and quickly became [publicity](https://twitter.com/TheNYFF/status/1442193742396465155) for the film. Nobody blocked access to the venue. There wasn't any violence. (The middlebrows still appreciate peaceful protests, don't they?) Second, it's easy to [point and laugh](https://twitter.com/TomiLaffly/status/1442202169386536961), but not every spiritual person with a cardboard sign is a member of a hate group. They may sometimes have a point.

If another prominent European director released a different movie treating Islam or Judaism as a cheap magic show, as a source of prurient interest, I imagine these same critics would demand retractions and apologies. They wouldn't hesitate to beat their own social media pulpits in self-righteous fury. But when it comes to Catholicism, there's no problem, right?

One stringer raised an inadvertent point when [she said](https://twitter.com/TomiLaffly/status/1442198523198337025), "Bought my tix as soon as I heard itâ€™s a sexy nun movie---can't wait." She meant to be clever, if not superior, but there's a whole worldview packed in there.

The 'sexy nun' is a loaded representation, half way between fetish object and power fantasy, and it's the movie's one big draw. The same story about two priests wouldn't have sold to a distributor, because movies about homosexual men rarely go mainstream. If it somehow had, nobody would be gleefully posting about it, because contemporary film culture doesn't champion gay men in quite the same overzealous way it will champion gay women. If "Benedetta" were an earnest film about religious life, the public interest would approach zero, and the critical interest would follow.

I'm tired of critics who'd rather be glib than curious or empathetic. Who call themselves journalists, and see a story, but don't ask questions. Who have such an obviously narrow perspective. Who will no doubt take Verhoeven's statements about his work purely at face value. And I'm especially tired of the political gamesmanship that surrounds so much of film culture. The discourse is bad, and it's barely begun.
