{% capture bio %}
My name is Tom Bomba. I'm a rando on the internet who likes movies, novels, comics, and video games with a strong sense of place. Give me Lone Pine or Warsong Gulch. Give me the Salinas Valley (where I know the names of secret flowers). Give me Jack and Duke among the Monument buttes. Put me back on the Chisolm Trail, or with London again in the north. Give me locations you can live in and dream in and come back to. Then give me story and more story. A protagonist with values, good or bad. Give me self generated American mythology writ larger than large, telling us about ourselves but also telling on ourselves. Give me art or trash. High culture or low. Doesn't matter. I want to talk about something with something to say.{% endcapture %}
