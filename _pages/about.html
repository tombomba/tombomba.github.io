  <p>There are quite a few crix out there who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This site is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express things I don’t see routinely expressed.</p>

  <p>My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around NYU’s cinema studies program before I “dropped out of college to get an education.” I’ve spent my time since producing digital media.</p>

  <p>The site was created on a Macintosh using Jekyll, Atom, and Pixelmator while listening to KCRW Los&nbsp;Angeles.</p>

  {% if site.tags.about.size > 2 %}
    <p>For a little more biography, by way of the movies, read these posts:</p>

    <ul class="ul-plain-condensed">
    {% for p in site.tags.about limit: 10 %}
      <li><a href="{{ p.url | prepend: site.url }}">{{ p.title | strip | normalize_whitespace | smartify }}</a></li>
    {% endfor -%}
    </ul>

    <p>If you need to get in touch, email “hello” at this domain.</p>
