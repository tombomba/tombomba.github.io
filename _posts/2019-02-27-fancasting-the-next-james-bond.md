[Critics fancast](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/actors-next-james-bond-dev-patel-idris-elba-henry-golding-1202047287/) Idris Elba, Henry Golding, Daniel Kaluuya, Shazad Latif, Dev Patel, Robert Pattinson, and Colin Salmon.

These are surprisingly good picks. I never would have thought of half these actors, especially Shazad Latif, lately appearing on "Star Trek: Discovery." Henry Fielding, too. He has something of a lighter persona, as seen in "Crazy Rich Asians," and I can picture him approaching the role the way Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan did. Daniel Kaluuya's breakout turn in "Get Out" proved he can do light and charming and another performance, in "Widows" last year, demonstrated he can play a lethal coldness.

That said, I'm something of a Bond traditionalist. I have a few sticking points on who plays him. One is that the actor needs to be a subject of the Queen, or the next best equivalent, a citizen of the Commonwealth. Bond is an icon and, when he first appeared, a point of pride for a country with a fading Empire and numerous Cold War-driven scandals. Casting outside the realm would be unseemly, like having a Brit play Superman _(ahem)_.

Another point is that Bond must be under 45, which author Ian Fleming described as the "mandatory retirement age" for agents with the double-O designation. The character is a male power fantasy. Virility writ large. I can't watch Bond dodder around far-flung locales while the actor playing him looks like he should be drawing a pension.

Race, in this case, doesn't matter. Fleming once described Bond as looking similar to actor and musician Hoagy Carmichael (see inset, above). But ethnicity isn't inherent to the character and Bond's background is only briefly drawn over the course of a dozen novels.

Within that field I'd pick either Dev Patel or Daniel Kaluuya. They're both young and London born, with enough range to do the job. "A skinny Bond," as a friend termed it, would be a nice contrast to Daniel Craig's more grimdark take and a good counter to 007's American competition, such as Jack Ryan, Jason Bourne, and Ethan Hunt.
