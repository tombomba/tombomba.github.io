"Planet of the Apes," 1968. Remember the ending? Okay, good. So maybe you can tell me how Taylor, the astronaut played by Charlton Heston, didn't realize where he was from the start. Because he should have.

"Planet" is a cultural touchstone; everyone knows it even if they've never seen it. A group of astronauts travel to a distant galaxy and crash land on an alien planet. Apes rule, humans drool. Taylor alone escapes the upside-down civilization with the help of a couple of sympathetic chimpanzees. By the end, he faces a terrible truth: he's not where he thought he was. Cue Heston sobbing on the beach and one of the most famous images in American movies.

To get to that payoff, the filmmakers had to be sneaky.

Right before Taylor makes his getaway from Apetown proper, Cornelius and Zaia, his two chimp buddies, tell him it's a three day ride into the Forbidden Zone to the Cave of Forgotten Artifacts and the movie's Big Twist. That journey takes place largely off-screen, but it means Taylor rode through open country with no electric power and thus no light pollution. In all that time, how did he fail to look up into the night sky and recognize the stars overhead? Taylor spends the movie thinking he's on a distant planet but he should have known where he was immediately, the first time night fell. The character is a trained astronaut. Even a regular joe would know their own set of stars.

There's a point where it's silly to nitpick. This is a film about talking apes living in the future and they're apes that speak perfect, late 20th century English. We gotta suspend enough disbelief to let the filmmakers tell their story. With this one little nit, though, I suspect someone at the typer or behind the camera knew the deal, because the entirety of "Planet of the Apes" takes place during the day. There are no scenes at night and, once he's captured, Taylor spends most of his time indoors. The lighting itself is bright and clear, as if it were always high noon. That couldn't have been happenstance. The movie sidesteps the question---how did Taylor miss the moon?---by never giving it a chance to cross the audience's mind.

Like I said. Sneaky.
