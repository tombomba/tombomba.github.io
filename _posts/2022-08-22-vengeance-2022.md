Written like an episode of a sitcom, and one cancelled after half a season. The humor in "Vengeance" is flat and uninspired, and the characters aren't developed beyond a single punchline. The movie regurgitates hoary clich√©s about country life and city folk as if it were making sharp observations.

Writer-director (and star!) B.J. Novak's Ben Manalowitz is both shallow and underwritten; his decision to hop on a plane and attend the funeral of a woman he barely remembers is largely unmotivated. Ben's subsequent choice to exploit her death is ghoulish, and this is where the film gets weirdly meta. 

The character's arc is about a cynical New Yorker's realization that his exes' life and death matters more than his career, and that (surprise surprise) the people living in Texas are real people with real feelings. But "Vengeance" doesn't really care about what it's meant to care about. 

The movie's treatment of character and setting are too superficial to believe otherwise. Novak presents the girl's family as rubes and yokels, and  sketches them broadly, his actors performing as if they just stumbled away from a "Hee Haw" reboot.
