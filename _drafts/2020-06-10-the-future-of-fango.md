The Fango crowd overplayed their hand & gave Cinestate an easy out.

Their original announcement was fiery but the staff had no leverage.

What were they prepared to do if Cinestate ignored their demands? Resign en masse? If they were prepare to do that, they would have already done it.

I think Fango will struggle to find a buyer, unless someone within the industry comes to the rescue.

The print mag probably runs at a loss & the podcast network cratered over the last week.

The brand itself might be the most valuable element of the business.

Meanwhile their final statement makes it sound as if their inevitable closure is their choice, not Cinestate's.

Now Dallas Sonnier can now walk away without further damage to his studio's brand, which is probably what he always cared about most.
