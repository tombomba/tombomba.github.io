I'm old enough to remember when killing children on screen was considered bad taste, if not more than a little manipulative. But then what do I know? The crix gauged "Tigers Are Not Afraid" 97% fresh. The film, produced in Mexico, and originally "Vuelven" (literally "They Return"), centers on two children living in a ghost town created by narco violence. El Shine leads a group of street kids, stealing whatever he needs and sleeping wherever he can find a squat. Estrella is a recent orphan, and literally haunted by victims of the local cartel. The opening introduces a main plot and a couple subplots, which automatically makes the film more ambitious than most. Unfortunately, "Tigers Are Not Afraid" never becomes greater than the sum of its parts. The crime story is bland, badly paced, and unnecessarily violent. The gangsters are interchangeable, just adults with guns, albeit guns often pointed at small children. The supernatural elements are mostly spooky voices and desiccated corpses. Remove them, and maybe you'd lose a mood and a theme, but the main story wouldn't change. So what does that tell you? "Tigers" fails because it attempts to cross light fantasy with stock horror with graphic brutality. It almost must fail, because the reality of the film, what it's really addressing, is too ugly to be dramatized without become grotesque.
