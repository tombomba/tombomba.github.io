{% capture bio %}I wanted to do a western movie blog, but bigger and broader and not so stuck in time. Most of the sites around this subject are terrific, but reading them sometimes feels as if the world stopped in the mid-1970s.

I'm also interested in what might be considered sorta 'western adjacent,' and in material that takes American culture and re-interprets it. So I may talk about "Mad Max", "Coup de Torchon," and "Tears of the Black Tiger" alongside "The Searchers" and "Red River." 

My name is Tom Bomba. I'm not anyone you know. I've knocked around here and there, and currently live west of the Mississippi. But really, I'm just another guy on the internet who likes what he likes and likes talking about what he likes. That's it. 

The logotype is set in Averia Serif Libre from Dan Sayers. The horseshoe icon was designed by Guilherme Schmitt for the Noun Project. The rest of the design is deliberately simple, to avoid the more obvious iconography.{% endcapture -%}
