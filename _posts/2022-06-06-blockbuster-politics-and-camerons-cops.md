Aaron Stewart-Ahn [gushes](https://twitter.com/somebadideas/status/1532899847048683520): "That he made his villain an icon of the L.A.P.D before the Rodney King tape was released, and then pushed it even harder in his script for Strange Days...What happened to blockbuster movies saying [fuck the police](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/terminator-2-commentary-policing/) as hard as James Cameron?"

Stewart-Ahn can't seem to recall a time before September, 2001. When the country leaned right, but not hard right. When our system was ugly, but not this ugly. He doesn't remember, or never knew, what happened in Los Angeles when Cameron was making his movies.

Back then, the L.A.P.D. instituted a policy leading to the harrassment and [arrest of some 50,000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Hammer_(1987)). They also [killed a single mom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Eula_Love) in broad daylight. Then there was [May, 1991](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Rodney+King+video). Years later, [Rampart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_scandal). Cameron lived and worked in Los Angeles during this period. So when he chose police officers for his villains, it wasn't prescience. It was a reflection what was already in the street and on the news.

Sure, there's a political angle to the choice in "Terminator 2." But the new T-1000 could have taken a different form without altering the movie's larger story. The character then is nothing more than a costume. His physical appearance a jab that might have been a hook, at least in a film with more serious intentions.

Bilge Ebiri [replied](https://twitter.com/BilgeEbiri/status/1533295627064451074) to Stewart-Ahn, saying, "It's funny how people have forgotten there was an actual controversy over how Cameron made the U.S. military the bad guys in Avatar."

There was no controversy, unless you pay mind to fringe websites and cranky periodicals. (Or, for some reason, wish to lend their ideas credibility by referencing an [imaginary beef](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Movies/politics-avatar-conservatives-attack-movies-political-messaging/story?id=9484885) more than a decade later.)

"Avatar's" politics were implicit in its premise, because you can't write a story about one state invading another without being political. Yet their treatment was superficial, never the focus, just as with "T2." Cameron once again made it easy to ignore the message and enjoy the spectacle, rendering his movie's positions inconsequential.

This may be his lasting influence. "Starship Troopers," "War of the Worlds", "Winter Soldier," and "Fury Road," among others, also combined unsophisticated stories with empty politics. Years on, audiences still engage with the action, but not so much with the message.
