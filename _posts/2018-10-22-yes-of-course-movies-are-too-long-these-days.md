title: "Are movies too long these days?"
excerpt: "Yes, of course they are. There was no reason for recent blockbusters to be as long as they were. But let's make a few distinctions, just the same."

[Yes](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/10/should-movies-be-shorter-1202014312/), of course they are. There was no reason for something like "Avengers: Infinity War" or "Mission Impossible: Fallout" to be 2&frac12; hours long.

But let's make a few distinctions. Good movies are as long as they need to be. Bad movies are as long as you want because you can always walk out. What's left is the Vast Middle, the thousand movies that make no impression and leave no memory.

A lot of those are summer tentpoles, action flicks, and blockbuster wannabes. With bigger casts and more set pieces, little remains for character and story. Director James Mangold laid out the math when he talked about [franchise fatigue](https://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/the-business/james-mangold-on-logan-and-fighting-franchise-fatigue) last year:

> There are so many characters that each character gets an arc of about 6&frac12; minutes at best, and I'm not exaggerating. You take 120 minutes, you take 45 of it for action, what are you left with, divide it by 6 characters, you have the character arc of Elmer Fudd in a Warner Brothers cartoon.

Movies are longer because they're developed around trailer moments. It's tough to come in under 2 hours when your ending alone needs 30 minutes of wall-to-wall action.

Longer runtimes translates into fewer showings, which means smaller box office. To compensate requires additional screens---more multi in our plex---but this has other, unintended effects. If the next "Star Wars" demands more screens because it's 3 hours long, there will be slots in the schedule for the small romcom, indie horror, or adult melodrama. There's less room to play when fat studio movies take up half the space.

I also think a large part of this rests on perceived value. When color television debuted and Old Hollywood needed to compete, they churned out widescreen epics and advertised on new technology like 3-D and Cinemascope. A similar strategy is at work today. To draw audiences from the living room, theatrical releases are sold as a premium experience---bigger screens, plush seats, better food, longer runtimes---to give us our money's worth.
