Isn't this what the movies are for?

Started watching randomly on twitch and was quickly sucked in. 

Great adventure.

Terrific through-line. The guy we think is the villain roams the countryside killing bandits. In his off time, he hangs out a local brothel. Whenever he kills, he leaves behind the calling card of a lost love. He does this to get her attention (!!!). 

I loved the way the movie teases out the villain's motivations. It really kept me invested in what was happening. I just had to know why, and so kept watching. 

The fight scenes are alright. Hyper kinectic wuxia craziness. Nothing more notable than the average Shaw Bros outing. I did like how the film gradually increased the complexity of the fights, how the violence became more explicit, and how every major opponent sported weapons and a style different from the last.  

But the scope and complexity of the story is something special. The film juggles half a dozen characters and while everybody is in love with everybody else, no love is requited. 

The ending is grand romantic fantasy and naturally a downer. Nobody gets what they wants! And the guy we thought was a villain dies protecting the prostitute who loves him (even though he loves someone else, haha).

What sets this apart is ALL of the action is motivated by character. There's no thin plot motivations like in contemporary American films. No bullshit macguffin to keep the plot turning. 

Occasionally hits the audience with great colors or composition. There's a few striking shots here and there in the middle of the action. 

Lotsa crazy violence too. People killing themselves to prove their honor, etc. A guy getting stabbed in the mouth.
