There are quite a few critics online who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This website is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express ideas I don't see routinely expressed.

My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around New York University's cinema studies program before I "dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing various forms of digital media.

_{{ site.title }}_ is intentionally basic, the design a sorta mental note to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. But it also looks this way because I miss the old web of _Hotwired_ and _Word_ and _jodi.org_, when it seemed more things were possible.

The name is a loose reference to work by Pauline Kael and Jeffrey Sconce. I could pontificate at a good, uniformed length about "trash versus art," but I'll spare us both. I do think _trash_ is an elastic term, though, and that the movies are often better at it than art. Truth be told I'd rather watch a Roger Corman flick or a Hopalong Cassidy serial than some of the recent festival winners from Europe.

The site was built on an ancient Macintosh using Jekyll, Atom, and Pixelmator, while listening to KCRW Los Angeles.
