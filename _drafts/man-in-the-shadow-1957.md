Solid b-picture written by Gene Coon. Gene Coon!!! And Orson Welles, of all people, as the heavy.<!--more--> Great opening, 10 minutes or so of silent footage, no dialogue, as a coupla cowhands drag a ranchero out of the bunkhouse and into the toolshed to beat the hell out of him. He fights back. The overhead light knocked, moving, throwing the figures into light and shadow. And then one of the picks up an axe handle and brains him dead. You think, but why?

Cut to a pretty young woman at a window, listening. Ah, that's why. Again, no dialogue, none needed. The rest is a good, tight thriller. A little disappointed that the ending was predicated on violence (the sherriff can't really arrest the big rancher, sooo...) and that so much of the plot involved the ranchers continually overplaying their hand with violence. Like, if you'd done nothing that sherriff would have nothing to do.
