title: "Next in tiresome discourse: The power and problems with your sexy nun movie"

Too many contemporary critics are smug when they should be thoughtful. Case in point: The [film twit reaction](https://twitter.com/search?q=benedetta%20protest&src=typed_query) to a small protest outside the NYFF showing of "Benedetta," Paul Verhoeven's [lesbian nun movie](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=verhoeven+benedetta+trailer).

A dozen Catholics from a right-leaning fringe group made noise this Sunday afternoon. Right outside a movie theater. There was a megaphone, and bagpipes. One guy played drums. A sign read, "Why the endless insults to Jesus?" Another, "I'm Catholic. Stop attacking my faith."

First, who cares? It was an insignificant rally, and quickly became [accidental publicity](https://twitter.com/TheNYFF/status/1442193742396465155) for the film. Nobody blocked access to the venue. There wasn't any violence. (The middlebrows still appreciate peaceful protests, don't they?) Second, it's easy to [point and laugh](https://twitter.com/TomiLaffly/status/1442202169386536961), but not every spiritual person with a cardboard sign is a member of a hate group. They may sometimes have a point.

If another prominent European director released a different movie that treated Islam or Judaism as a cheap magic show, as a source of prurient interest, I imagine these same critics would demand retractions and apologies. They wouldn't hesitate to beat their own social media pulpits in self-righteous fury. But when it comes to Catholicism, fuck it, there's no problem, right?

One stringer raised an inadvertent point when [she said](https://twitter.com/TomiLaffly/status/1442198523198337025), "Bought my tix as soon as I heard itâ€™s a sexy nun movie---can't wait." She meant to be clever, if not superior, but there's a whole worldview packed in there.

The admitted draw is the sex, not the religion. The 'sexy nun' is a loaded representation, half way between fetish object and power fantasy. If the movie contained same story, but about two priests, it wouldn't have sold to a distributor, because movies about homosexual men rarely go mainstream. If it somehow had, nobody would be gleefully posting about it, because contemporary film culture doesn't champion gay men the same way it champions gay women. If "Benedetta" were an earnest film about religious life, there would be far less critical interest. The public interest would approach zero.

I'm tired of lazy jabs at Catholicism just because. I'm tired of critics who'd rather be glib than curious or empathetic. And I'm tired of the political gamesmanship that surrounds so much of film culture. The discourse is bad, and it's barely begun.
