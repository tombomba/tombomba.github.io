James Cameron's [old quote](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/terminator-2-commentary-policing/) is making the rounds...[again](https://twitter.com/ashdabbath/status/1532839808896094208):

> The 'Terminator' films are not really about the human race getting killed of by future machines. They're about us losing touch with our own humanity and becoming machines, which allows us to kill and brutalize each other. Cops think all non-cops as less than they are, stupid, weak, and evil. They dehumanize the people they are sworn to protect and desensitize themselves in order to do that job.

> That he made his villain an icon of the LAPD before the Rodney King tape was released, and then pushed it even harder in his script for Strange Days… What happened to blockbuster movies saying fuck the police as hard as James Cameron?


I mean ... 9/11 happened

But also weird to me when Angelenos don't know LA history.

Such as the death of Eula Mae Love, mother of 3 young kids, who was killed by the LAPD in broad daylight in 1979. (The officers involved were exonerated.)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Eula_Love

Or the LAPD's "Operation Hammer," under which 50,000 people were arrested over a 2 year period in a supposed effort to curb 'gang violence.'

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Hammer_(1987)

Pretty sure James Cameron was living in Los Angeles during the 1980s, and as such would have been aware of what was going down. 

Making the T-1000 an LA cop is a natural choice. Not so prescient. It's not as if the Rodney King beating happened in some sorta cultural vacuum.

Meanwhile, STRANGE DAYS was conceived in '86 and released in '95, sorta sandwiched in between "Operation Hammer," Rodney King, and Rampart.

> It’s funny how people have forgotten there was an actual controversy over how Cameron made the US military the bad guys in AVATAR.

People wanna give AVATAR points but its cultural effect was a little pernicious, I think (on top of giving theaters an excuse to jack prices...again)

The movie was so overloaded with spectacle one could ignore its story—as well as its politics—and just enjoy the visuals

This was roughly the same template later used by the Russo's with WINTER SOLDIER and CIVIL WAR, and by George Miller with FURY ROAD

Any political position these movies held were inconsequential next to their perceived value as pop art or mass entertainment
