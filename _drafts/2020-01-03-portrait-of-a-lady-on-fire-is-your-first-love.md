<!--If I could, I'd run up to you, arms full of adjectives and adverbs, and drop them all at your feet in a mad instant, and say "See? This is what it's like and you should see it." I'm not a good enough writer to do that, to tell you everything at once and make it meaningful. Céline Sciamma's film is remarkable in a way that can't be summed up in a few hundred words. It needs to be seen and felt. But I will tell what I can. -->

It looks into your past and glances over your shoulder as you shyly ask, "When did you first notice me?" It's a worn and yellowed Penguin novel, the one you read in high school, with long passages underlined in soft pencil, the one you still think about but never talk about, the one with flashes of night and desire. It's the old master in the local museum whose subject may be domestic life, or pastoral, but whose spirit borrows from Shelley and Keats, and who hand borrows from Delacroix and Friedrich.

The story exists in a place where women live, and only women, where men may have shaped life but do not define it. Marianne is a painter and the daughter of a painter yet she has her own name and makes her own career. Héloïse is the child of landed gentry but balks at being possessed in love and traded in marriage. Even Sophie, the maid, has her life touched by a man and still chooses by herself and for herself.

Director Céline Sciamma sidesteps the class and etiquette and politics of the 19th century to address those subjects now, today. She shows us things other filmmakers don't, or won't, and she shows them as matter-of-fact. A woman in need of an abortion is normal. The love between two others is hopeful. There is no mention of God, or sin, or the devil. There is no talk of duty, honor, and virtue.
