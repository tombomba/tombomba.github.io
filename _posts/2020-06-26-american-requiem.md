["Love is the message, and the message is Death"](https://www.moca.org/program/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death) is a collection of found images, Getty archives, news broadcasts, dashcam reels, and video clips, edited and arranged by Arthur Jafa, set to Kanye's ["Ultalight Beam,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oHdAA3AqnE) and made into a work of extraordinary art.

Jafa is an artist and cinematographer who has worked with Julie Dash and Spike Lee. "Love is the message" is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, MoCA Los Angeles, SF MoMA, and the High Museum of Art. The film is playing in [virtual screenings](https://hirshhorn.si.edu/news/press-release/love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death-streamed-june-26-28/) at 13 museums this weekend.

In seven minutes and thirty seconds of striking images, I think the one that will stick with me is a simple close up of a woman's face, probably shot from a camera phone. She's riding in a car and as I looked at her, the expression on her face, I got the overwhelming feeling that she was coming from a funeral. I don't know who she was or where she was or where she was going but her eyes looked out for a mile and saw nothing.

"Love is the message, and the message is Death" is a short film. Most of the footage is all too recent, captured in the last 5 or 10 years. This is not an easy film to watch but it's necessary to watch.
