Gregory Peck wears the black hat in a western directed by William Wellman. A group of bank robbers cross the desert and discover an old man and a young girl living in a ghost town. The pair sit on an abandoned mining fortune and these thieves want a cut. Loyalties split early, as some of the men are more interested in the girl than the gold, and factions lines become narrower and narrower. Lotsa noir shades, but not as try-hard as some others (it thankfully lacks the all too typical glib dialogue). "Yellow Sky" is littered with grimy characters who wouldn't be out of place in a Mann picture, and they're played by good actors. Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark, John Russell, Harry Morgan. Anne Baxter stands out as a tomboy with a six gun on her hip who doesn't melt for anyone. Wellman shot on location in Death Valley, and there's some strong compositions among the high desert crags, with sound to match, as voices and gunfire reverberate off the rocks with a hollow echo. Produced around the time of Ford's calvary trilogy and Hawk's "Red River," the movie looks cruder and cleaner, and plays nastier, as if it  might have been made 10 or 20 years later.
