I'm old enough to remember when killing children on screen was considered bad taste, if not more than a little manipulative. But then what do I know? The crix gauged "Tigers Are Not Afraid" 97% fresh. The film, produced in Mexico, and originally "Vuelven" (literally "They Return"), centers on two children living in a ghost town created by narco violence. El Shine leads a group of street kids, stealing whatever he needs and sleeping wherever he can find a squat. Estrella is a recent orphan, and literally haunted by victims of the local cartel. The opening introduces a main plot and a couple subplots, which automatically makes the film more ambitious than most.

Unfortunately, "Tigers Are Not Afraid" never becomes greater than the sum of its parts. A crime story focuses on a missing cell phone, one Shine pickpocketed and some gangsters want returned. It's about as bland as it sounds, because the bad guys are faceless,  interchangeable, just adults with guns (albeit adults with guns often pointed at small children). The supernatural elements plaguing Estrella are mostly spooky voices and desiccated corpses. Standard stuff. Remove them, and maybe you'd lose a mood and a theme, but the main story wouldn't change. So what does that tell you? In the end, "Tigers" fails because it attempts to cross light fantasy with stock horror with graphic brutality. I think it deserves to fail, because this was never a good idea. The reality of the film, what it's really addressing, and who it is about, is too ugly to be dramatized this way without become grotesque.
