{% capture bio %}There are quite a few critics online who are smart and skilled and say interesting
things. This website is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express ideas I
don't see routinely expressed.

My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around New York University's cinema studies program before I
"dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing various forms of
digital media.

_{{ site.name }}_ is intentionally basic, the design made crude as a sorta mental note to myself not to write as if I'm
submitting for publication. The name is a loose reference to work by Pauline Kael and Jeffrey
Sconce.

The site was built on an old Mac using Jekyll, VS Code, and Pixelmator, while listening to KCRW Los
Angeles.{% endcapture -%}
