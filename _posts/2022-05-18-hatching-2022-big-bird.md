"Hatching" (orig. "Pahanhoutoja") is Finnish family horror with a hard psychological edge. Story is about a girl who finds a strange bird's egg in the forest, brings it home to suburbia, and watches it grow larger and larger until one evening the egg hatches and a huge, ugly bird-thing emerges. She loves it as you might a child, and the creature transforms under her care, becoming almost recognizably human. It then develops needs of its own, and begins to roam.

I said story when I shoulda said plot, because the movie's really about the girl's relationship with her mother, and the creature is a gorey metaphor representing that relationship. Mom is an overbearing vlogger who arranges her life Martha Stewart style, with house and kids always insta ready. (The film opens from the perspective of Mom's phone, as she records her next post, naturally involving the whole family.) Dad is, by contrast, shy and gentle, so much so that he doesn't object when his wife renders him a cuckold later in the film. The girl's younger brother is a mean little bastard, resentful of the attention the girl receives. (Like his sister, he is sharply observant, and also like his sister, his observations are ignored.) Both parents are self involved and insipid, and both are oblivious to the pained expressions their children regularly wear.

Away from her family, the girl is smart and amiable, soft spoken, and unsure of herself. Her mother pushes her to excel at gymnastics. There's never an indication the girl enjoys the sport, only that she believes she must be perfect, and in all things, to gain her mother's time and attention. The more the girl tries and fails to win a place on the local team, the harder her mother works her. I cringed when Mom enthused about live streaming an upcoming competition, once again treating the kid as #content, ignoring her daughter's horrified reaction. (It never occurs to the mother that a camera with a thousand eyes behind it might bring additional pressure to bear.)

The movie is good. It might even be great, depending on your context. There's an efficiency in the storytelling, the basics off and running some 15 or 20 minutes in, each scene saying as much as it needs to and no more. The metaphor is apparent; you can't miss it. The creature is an external rep of the girl's unexpressed feelings, the part of herself that accepts her mom's bullshit at face value, her sense of self-worth living and breathing on her mother's thoughtlessness. While the girl might struggle to express her needs, the bird-thing doesn't have that problem.

There are times where the film might play the metaphor a little too hard. There are probably scores of evil twin and creepy dummy movies covering similar ground, but "Hatching" sets itself apart in the way the girl doesn't understand the creature's nature. She approaches it with kindness. This made, for me, the sequences where she feeds it, grooms it, and sleeps next to it all the more difficult to watch. She protects this loathsome thing, and in nurturing it, she nurtures her own self hatred.
