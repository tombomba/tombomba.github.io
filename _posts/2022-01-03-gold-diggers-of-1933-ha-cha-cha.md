A blueblood songwriter falls in love with a Broadway showgirl, but his family won't hear of it. A brother and an uncle come around to stop the affair, so the showgirl's friends, a trio of down and outers, decide to scam Mr Hoity and Mr Toity. And why not? If someone thinks you cheap and vulgar you might as well play the part and play them, too. What follows is witty rejoinder on top of witty rejoinder, rat-a-tat-tat style, with crazy plans and mad hijinks, and dancing, of course, and more and more hijinks. By the end it's a case of mistaken identity (you don't say), and confusion and revelation, then love all around and a smattering of marriages (oh, what a surprise). It's a familiar story with familiar beats, bookended by grand musical numbers staged by Busby Berekely.

"Gold Diggers" struck me as the same kinda dizzy one might find in vaudeville, or low theater, or whatever it's called, those 18th century operas produced for the workaday stiffs, now made fresh with the moneyed sense of Old Hollywood and given over to a sorta art deco bohemianism---everybody in this world is good looking and fashionable and well appointed, rich or poor. I got the feeling the producers wanted to acknowledge the social ill of the Great Depression, and thought the best way to do it was to pile on as much sex and glamour as one movie could stand. So the result is this always entertaining entertainment, but strange in a way, too. A picture where the young and the beautiful make jokes about not having enough to eat, or sing songs about forgotten veterans on the breadline, and doing it while wearing a hat that cost more than a month of working class wages.
