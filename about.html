{% capture bio %}
_{{ site.title }}_ began years ago in an attempt to join what seemed a vital online conversaton. I work on it now in fits and starts. It is my thousand piece puzzle on the dining room table, my model ship in the den, my hand made canoe in the garage. 

My name is Tom Bomba. I work in digital media. I once flirted with NYU's cinema studies program, but found the words _filmic_ and _split diopter_ and _mise-en-scÃ¨ne_ made me cringe. I've only ever gone to the movies for the story.

_{{ site.title }}_ is intentionally basic, the design a sorta mental note to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. The name is a loose reference to work by Pauline Kael and Jeffrey Sconce.

The site was built on an old Macintosh using VS Code and Pixelmator, while listening to KCRW Los&nbsp;Angeles. The various icons lying around are courtesy of Twemoji, an open source program supported by Twitter.

There are quite a few critics online who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This website is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express ideas I don't see routinely expressed.

My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around NYU's cinema studies program before I "dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing various forms of digital media.
