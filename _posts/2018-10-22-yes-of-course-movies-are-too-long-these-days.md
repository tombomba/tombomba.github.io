[Yes](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/10/should-movies-be-shorter-1202014312/), of course they are. But let's make a few distinctions. Good Movies are as long as they need to be. Bad Movies are as long as you want, because you can always walk out. What's left is the Vast Middle: the thousand movies that make no impression and leave no memory.

It takes focus and discipline to operate in a short form. Commercial pressure and changing tastes means we might lose the movies---the 90 or 120 minute cinematic novella---to Netflix and Amazon, to the 10 episode formula, to binge watching and bloated tentpoles. Too many studio pictures are fattened by large casts and multiple set pieces. Too many indies contain only a sitcom premise, teased out to feature length.

I don't know of a solution except for good writing, but then good writing takes time. Every studio has money to fund the next project but few have time to make a Good Movie.
