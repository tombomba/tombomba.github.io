{% capture bio %}
This website is a thousand-piece puzzle on my dining room table, a model kit in my den, a handmade canoe in my garage. I began working on it years ago, to join what seemed vital online conversation, and return now in fits and starts.

My name is Tom Bomba. I once flirted with NYU's cinema studies program but ran when I heard words like _filmic_ and _split diopter_ around campus. My interest in movies remains with writing, with story and character, and not with _mise-en-sc√®ne._

_{{ site.title }}_ is intentionally basic, the design a mental note to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. The title is a loose reference to essays by Pauline Kael and Jeffrey Sconce.

Everything here was built on an old Macintosh, using VS Code and Pixemator, while listening to KCRW Los Angeles.
