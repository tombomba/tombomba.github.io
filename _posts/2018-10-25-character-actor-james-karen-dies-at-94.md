Film critic and historian Leonard Maltin wrote [a lovely eulogy](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-james-karen-appreciation-leonard-maltin-20181025-story.html) for the L.A. Times. Genre fans will remember Karen's appearances in "Poltergeist" and "Return of the Living Dead" but I still think of him, fondly, as the [Pathmark Man](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=james+karen+pathmark+commercials).
