_{{ site.title }}_ began years ago. It is my thousand piece puzzle on the dining room table, my model ship in the den, my hand made canoe in the garage. 

I listen to KCRW Los Angeles, carelessly, while working on it, and I never know the singers or the names of the songs. But I enjoy the music. Sometimes there is a small pleasure in listening and not knowing.

My name is Tom Bomba. I can go on, and it'll bore you. Chances are the sentence, the paragraph, the page you're reading right now will be considered and reworked and then discarded. Much like the other writing on this site, it may take a different form in the future.

Oh, p.s., the various icons littered around are courtesy of Twemoji, twitter dot com's open source emoji program. I am legally (and ethically, I think) required to tell you this by using them. So now you know.

There are quite a few critics online who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This website is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express ideas I don't see routinely expressed.

My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around NYU's cinema studies program before I "dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing various forms of digital media.

_{{ site.title }}_ is intentionally basic, the design a sorta mental note to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. The name is a loose reference to work by Pauline Kael and Jeffrey Sconce.

The site was built on an ancient Macintosh using VS Code and Pixelmator, while listening to KCRW Los&nbsp;Angeles.
