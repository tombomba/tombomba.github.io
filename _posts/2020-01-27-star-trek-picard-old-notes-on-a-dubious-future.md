The showrunners swore, in various interviews, they pitched Patrick Stewart a great concept. "Star Trek: Picard" would be a fresh chapter and a new direction. No one was interested in making "Next Generation 2."

Imagine my surprise when "Picard" begins with a cameo by a "Next Generation" cast member and ends with a shot of an iconic "Next Generation" spaceship. While I expect a level of continuity---this is a fictional universe from the 60s, with a protagonist from the 80s---I didn't anticipate gratuitous callbacks and cameos.

"Star Trek: Picard" is a pot luck of reboot ideas, playing on nostalgia and working over dated sci-fi concepts. While it looks good, with production values at a feature film level, the story is so insular and convoluted I doubt newcomers will make sense of it.

The show was created by Akiva Goldsman, Alex Kurtzman, and Michael Chabon, three people who shouldn't be near genre television, much less a franchise like "Star Trek." Kurtzman wrote "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" and produced the "Mummy" reboot. Chabon is an award winning novelist but still managed to attach himself to "John Carter." The less said about Goldsman's credits, the better.

"Picard's" first episode consists mostly of urgent conversations and a few new characters. A young woman named Dahj is attacked by a group of rogue agents who kill her boyfriend and send her on the run. She has visions of Picard and seeks him out. Naturally, he agrees to help and turns to Dr. Agnes Jurati. Because of a few other plot bumps, he needs information on Starfleet's research into artificial intelligence, which she dutifully supplies.

Most of this is for the benefit of the audience, to relate what's what over the last twenty years and kickstart a rather creaky plot. As when Picard agrees to a futuristic TV news interview, in a scene where characters sit across from one another and explain recent galactic history. (When the moment turns hostile, it's only to lend a sense a drama to otherwise flat dialogue.)

The use of Space CNN is an awkward narrative device but, more than that, the presence of mass media also demonstrates how "Star Trek's" idea of itself has changed. Traditionally, this was a franchise that eschewed bland representations of contemporary life.

Likewise the scattered references to a cataclysmic event on Romulus, and one to environmental tragedy on Mars.

<!-- The first episode of "Star Trek: Picard" is a pot luck of contemporary reboot ideas, slickly produced and playing on nostalgia and affection. It doesn't give you much to think about, but then it doesn't try to, either. -->
