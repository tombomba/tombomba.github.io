There's nothing in the photograph I can tell you about you can't already see for yourself. A young Debbie Harry enjoying a small moment in time. I don't know anything about anything, but if you're making a movie about kids and the 70s and music and calling it ["Licorice Pizza"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofnXPwUPENo) and you're not matching the energy and allure of Debbie in these known and unknown [photos by Chris Klein](https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/debbie-harry-unseen-pictures), what are you even doing? It's a bad judgement, I know. Too quick. Alls I've seen is the trailer. I haven't seen the movie and no one has, so how can I say with confidence? You're right. I can't. But then I think about the photo and think about the movie, the infinite possibilities of the one, the limited possibilities of the other, and...what are you even doing?
