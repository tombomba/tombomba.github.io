["Love Is the Message, and the Message Is Death"](https://www.moca.org/program/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death) is a collection of found images, news broadcasts, Getty archives, dashcam reels, and video clips, carefully edited and arranged, set to Kanye's ["Ultalight Beam,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oHdAA3AqnE) and made into a work of extraordinary art by Arthur Jafa.

Jafa is a cinematographer and artist who has worked with Spike Lee and Julie Dash, among others. This particular film was acquired by the Hirshhorn Museum along with the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2018. It played in [virtual screenings](https://hirshhorn.si.edu/news/press-release/love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death-streamed-june-26-28/) at 13 museums last month. Seek it out once the world re-opens.

"Love Is the Message, and the Message Is Death" is a Black history lesson in 7 minutes and thirty seconds. It depicts private joy and public brutality, the famous with the obscure. There is plenty of shocking violence. You'll recognize some of the news footage and remember when you saw it. Most is all too recent.

Yet you could also make a photo book from Jafa's collection, as each juxtaposition is more striking than the last. His genius lies in the timing and the edit, in the layering of sound and image, in showing Black pride alongside Black pain, and in achieving his effects using found objects and visual detritus. The contradiction between the images is his point; it fuels both empathy and rage.

One moment will stay with me: A close-up of a young woman riding silently in a car, her expression unchanging. Her gaze runs past the camera for a mile and a year, and keeps going, her face the face of someone who has seen too much in too short a time.

"Love Is the Message, and the Message Is Death" is a little like that, too. Saying something real without using words.
