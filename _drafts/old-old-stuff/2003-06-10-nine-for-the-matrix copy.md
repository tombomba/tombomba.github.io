The "Animatrix" DVD offers nine animated short films set in the world of the "Matrix" films. Here are nine things you need to know about the latest Wachowski effort.

- Every short has eye-popping, engrossing animation.
- Don't read the disclaimer that pops up when the DVD first loads. It ruins the climax of one of the better shorts.
- While "Final Flight of the Osiris" depicts events referenced in "The Matrix: Reloaded," and "Detective Story" and "Kid's Story" include cameos by Trinity and Neo, none of the shorts extend or deepen the storyline of the first two films.
- "Second Renaissance" isn't so much a story as voiceover exposition on top of Mobius-like animation. The amount of information packed into these twenty minutes could be a full-length feature (except that would be "T3: Rise of the Machines" territory).
- Only two shorts venture outside the already overplayed "What is real?" scheme. "Matriculated"---beautifully animated by "Aeon Flux's" Peter Chung---tells the story of humans who try to convince captured machines to join their side in the war. "Beyond," set in Japan and faintly reminiscent of Miyazaki's "Spirited Away," follows a little girl as she explores a local 'haunted' house.
- Some of the shorts succumb to the temptation of an "And then I woke up!" resolution. This is a cheap device in all stories; twice damned here given the obvious parallels with the whole premise of the Matrix.
- The spectacle of truly brilliant CGI doesn't hide the almost complete lack of story in "The Final Flight of the Osiris." And since Osiris is the setup for the "Enter the Matrix" videogame, it is ultimately clever cross-marketing, not entertainment or art.
- "Looney Tunes" achieved a greater level of story and entertainment in four minutes of the average Bugs Bunny cartoon than the average "Animatrix" short does in ten.
- The disc is most fittingly seen looped, without sound, on the plasma screen tv of Tokyo nightclub while the walls thump with European techo remixes.
