Story is about a big heist attempted during a zombie apocalypse. Script by Joby Harold, who also wrote "King Arthur: Legend of the Sword." Netflix will foot the bill. Snyder sounds eager to return to work. 

I have reservations about Snyder (remember "Sucker Punch"?) but there's a kernel of a good idea here---about whether it's possible to commit a crime in a land with no law.
