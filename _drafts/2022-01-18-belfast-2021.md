Kenneth Branaugh made a movie about working class Irish during The Troubles and shot the whole thing as if it were an Italian art house picture. That's certainly a choice, I suppose. His "Belfast" (Focus Features, 2021) is a quasi kitchen sink drama, but good looking and modern and slick. It concerns, or seems to concern, one family's decision to leave Ireland amidst the sectarian violence of August, 1969. I say "seems to concern" because although many things happen over the movie's 97 minutes, that's the only drama in it. A sorta provincial will they or won't they. (You may already know if you're familiar with Branaugh's life, as this story was written by him and inspired by his childhood.) The rest is episodic. "Belfast" simultaneously wants to be part coming of age tale and part political document. It's not enough of either.<!--more-->

 Branaugh focuses his movie on Buddy, a Protestant boy who operates as sorta narrative proxy, and the film's point of view is limited to that of a 9 year old. We can only see and understand what Buddy sees and understands. That choice hobbles the story, and it invariably leads to awkward sequences where the kid ducks behind fence posts and stairwells to eavesdrop on his parents, so the audience can overhear bits of exposition. Other scenes feature news reports on the radio or television ("fighting broke out today in..."), and it plays as flavor, the outside world curiously removed from the family's day to day worries. "Belfast" never tells you much about Belfast, because Branaugh reduces Northern Ireland's political and social complexity to a single street in a single city, and he's too carefully neutral in his depiction of it.

The kid, played by Jude Hill, is immediately likeable. Branaugh imagines him as an empty headed saint, precocious in the gentlest way possible. Buddy fudges his homework for a chance to sit closer to a girl in his class (and later, he shyly offers her flowers). He's unfailingly polite, and speaks with the same ebullient friendliness to anyone and everyone. He has the usual interest in toy cars and television shows. (Matchbox and "Thunderbirds," really.) He never curses. He never talks back. When he shoplifts, it's only because he was roped into it by his peers, not because he coveted something for himself. He's blameless and a little boring, and I wonder if Branaugh himself was really so dull as a child.

The rest of the cast includes some all timers. Judi Dench and Ciarán Hinds are very good together as Buddy's grandparents. Caitríona Balfe is perfectly at home in setting and period as his mother. She has a chameleon like quality; I didn't recognize her despite having watched 2 seasons of "Outlander." Jamie Dornan is Buddy's father, a man with hard choices to make. Lara McDonnell is notable as an impish neighborhood schoolgirl, and although the actress is playing young, she's too mature to convincingly run about as a friend to a little boy. The movie's appeal rests on this ensemble, on charming Irish actors playing charming Irish characters, photographed in charming black and white. There are moments that feel like a small wink and a gentle smile, but continuously, in scene over scene. When it works, it works. Like the characters, you forget the outside world.

Meanwhile Buddy rarely holds an opinion or expresses a preference, unlike every other child born into this world. I assume he inherits this quality from his parents, teachers, and neighbors. "Belfast" begins in mid-August, 1969, and during those weeks, TKTK, yet nobody in the movie has anything to say about it.

Instead, there's typical Hollywood drama with a main Bad Guy, a Protestant leader who pressures the Dad to join whatever group he's a part of. This is boring and too reduced. Too simple a representation of a complex problem.
