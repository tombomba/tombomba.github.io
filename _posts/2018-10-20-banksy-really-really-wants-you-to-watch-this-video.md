A coupla weeks ago "Girl with Balloon" sold at auction for $1.4 million and when the gavel came down, a mechanism housed in the frame [shredded](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/sotheby-s-banksy-ed-as-painting-self-destructs-live-at-auction) half of it. This week Banksy [revealed](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpDMo26h3Cu/?hl=en&taken-by=banksy) the prank didn't quite come off; he intended to destroy the entire painting but the gizmo jammed. Oh, well.

The best part is the look on the auctioneer's face. It's the same look a headmaster adopts when his worst student misbehaves during assembly---again.

Because "Shred the Love" is another promotional exercise. It's intended as a jab at the market, I guess, but the message doesn't land because it's impossible to effectively satirize something while benefitting from it. (He's still cashing the cheque, right?)

Banksy transformed himself from upstart street artist, [sneaking his work](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3201344.stm) into the Tate, to quasi-performance artist without a live audience. His real work is something that happened in the past, that you've only just heard about. It's made of gossip and rumor, not paint and canvas.

The commentary around him---like this one---tends to be stupid and obvious because the work is stupid and obvious. His  pieces require the larger story he's created around them. That's not art. It's marketing. Absent context, [nobody cares](https://www.thedailybeast.com/banksys-biggest-trick-yet-selling-his-art-on-the-street-for-dollar60).

Banksy is a brand, and "Shred the Love" is its newest ad.
