Very [faux grindhouse vibe](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=trailer+x+2022+ti+west+a24) with West mixing sub-genres. The visuals and scenarios look almost period boilerplate: sex, race, horror, check, check, check. I hope the film will have a point of view, something to say, and won't merely regurgitate old exploitation tropes.<!--more-->

Ti West has been out of the public eye for awhile; his last release was 5 or 6 years ago. His previous features usually gave you something to think about and something to talk about. Maybe that'll be true again. "X" catches my interest because West seems to be upending his style, like he wants to play to a different audience. A curious impulse in an established career.
