There are quite a few crix out there who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This website is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express things I don't see routinely expressed.

My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around NYU's cinema studies program before I "dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing digital media.
