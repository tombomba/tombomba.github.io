This website is my thousand-piece puzzle on the dining room table, my model kit in the den, my handmade canoe in the garage. I began working on it years ago, to join what seemed vital online conversation, and return now in fits and starts.

My name is Tom Bomba. I once flirted with NYU's cinema studies program but lost focus after a few semesters. (I may have taken one too many split diopters to the head.) My interest today remains with writing, with story and characters, and not so much with _mis-en-sc√®ne._

The site was made on an old Macintosh using VS Code and Pixelmator, while listening to KCRW Los Angeles.
