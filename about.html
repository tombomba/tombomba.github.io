Originally, I wanted to do a movie blog. Then I thought something around genre, maybe. Horror, sci-fi, schlock, exploitation, or paracinema. But then I discovered even the the nichiest of niches has too many rabid voices.

My name is Tom Bomba. I have no bylines or awards to show you. I am neither journalist nor critic, and I've never been on staff. I am another rando on the internet, starting from nowhere, and wanting to speak.

Eventually, I decided instead of a narrow slice of contemporary films, <i>{{ site.title }}</i> would be a site about the west. About American mythology through media. The rough borders of my interest stretching from the Mississippi to the Pacific, up through the Yukon, and down to Panama. Maybe a little further when I can manage.

I hope you enjoy it.
