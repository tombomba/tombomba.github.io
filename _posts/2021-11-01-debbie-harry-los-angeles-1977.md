There's nothing in the photograph I can tell you about you can't already see for yourself. A young Debbie Harry enjoys a moment in time. I don't know anything about anything, but if you're making a movie about kids and the 70s and music and calling it ["Licorice Pizza"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofnXPwUPENo) and you're not matching Debbie's [energy and allure](https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/debbie-harry-unseen-pictures), right here, in this single minute snapped by Chris Klein, if you're not at that level, if you're peddling another coming-of-age story and slapping "Life On Mars" on the ad, what are you even doing? It's a bad judgement, I know. Too quick. I haven't seen the movie and no one has. Alls I've seen is the trailer, so how can I say with confidence? You're right. I can't. But then I think about the photo and think about the movie, the infinite possibilities of the one and the limited possibilities of the other, and I'm back to...what are you even doing?
