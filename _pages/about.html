    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>Originally I thought: There are quite a few crix out there who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This site would be my attempt to join them. I’d make it for fun, but also to express things I didn’t see routinely expressed.</p>

<p>Then the world changed. Blogging changed. I changed.</p>

<p>My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around NYU’s cinema studies program before I “dropped out of college to get an education.” I’ve spent my time since producing digital media.</p>

<p>I’ve never won any prizes. I’ve never been published. I don’t have a byline to show you. But I watch, read, think, and write a lot and maybe that’s something.</p>

<p><em>{{ site.title }}</em> was created on a Macintosh using Jekyll, Atom, and Pixelmator while listening to KCRW Los&nbsp;Angeles. It was intentionally designed to look hand made and rough cut, like a cross between an mid-80s Loisaida zine and a mid-90s internet portal.</p>
