Story is about a big heist attempted during a zombie apocalypse. Script by Joby Harold, who also wrote "King Arthur: Legend of the Sword." [Snyder sounds eager](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/zack-snyder-returns-movies-zombie-pic-army-dead-1178979) to return to work. Netflix will take over for Warner Bros., where the project has kicked around since 2007. 

I have reservations about Snyder (remember "Sucker Punch"?) but there's a kernel of a good idea here---about whether it's possible to commit a crime in a land with no law.
