There are quite a few critics online who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This website is my attempt to join them (or, at least, join their conversation). I made it for fun, but also to express ideas I don't see routinely expressed.

My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around New York University's cinema studies program before I "dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing various forms of digital media.

_{{ site.title }}_ is intentionally basic, the design a sorta mental note to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. The name is a loose reference to work by Pauline Kael ("Trash, Art, and the Movies") and Jeffrey Sconce ("'Trashing' the academy: taste, excess, and the emerging politics of cinematic style").

My goal is to create something that sits comfortably among Barry Gifford's "Out of the Past: Adventures in Film Noir," Tom Spurgeon's "Comics Reporter," Jessa Crispin's "Book Slut," and Brian Collins' "Horror Movie a Day."

The site was built on an ancient Macintosh using Jekyll, Atom, and Pixelmator, while listening to KCRW Los Angeles.
