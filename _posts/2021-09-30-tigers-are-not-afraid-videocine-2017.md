I'm old enough to remember when killing children on screen was considered bad taste, if not more than a little manipulative. But then what do I know? The crix gauged "Tigers Are Not Afraid" 97% fresh. The film, produced in Mexico, and originally "Vuelven" (literally "They Return"), centers on two children living in a ghost town created by narco violence. El Shine leads a group of street kids, stealing whatever he needs and sleeping wherever he can find a squat. Estrella is a recent orphan, and literally haunted by victims of the local cartel. The opening introduces a main plot and a couple subplots, which automatically makes the film more ambitious than most. Unfortunately, "Tigers Are Not Afraid" never becomes greater than the sum of its parts. The crime story is bland, badly paced, and unnecessarily violent. The supernatural elements are stock horror, mostly spooky voices and desiccated corpses. The attempts to contrast childlike fantasy with graphic brutality fail, as they almost must, because the reality of cartel violence is too ugly to dramatize this way without becoming grotesque.
