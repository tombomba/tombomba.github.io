The AV Club guys always have a weird perspective to me, because it's the perspective almost completely informed by the last 15 years or so. Like, it's obvious "Bourne" is this guy's touchstone. He seems to think if a movie isn't fast paced or quick cut, it doesn't qualify.

Saying "in so many old Westerns, the action scenes are weirdly obligatory" doesn't make sense even with a cursory view of the genre (and "Rio Bravo" must be the most edge case example one could think of). I mean ... "My Darling Clementine"? "Shane"? "The Man from Laramie"? "Hondo"? "High Noon"? "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"? "Vera Cruz"? "The Bravados"? "Winchester '73"? "The Gunfighter"? "The Professionals"? That's just a sample of the American ones. His claim becomes more ridiculous if you consider movies from Spain, Italy, and Australia.

AV Club Guy also looks at westerns, and he thinks about shoot outs and fist fights -- because those define movies like "Bourne Identity" and "John Wick" --- when he should be thinking about horses. There are B and C and D westerns with thrilling, crazy, dangerous horse stunts that rival almost anything from the more obviously mechanized previous 40 years. Eg: Take the runaway stagecoach sequences in "The Hanging Tree" or "Riding Shotgun." Or the stagecoach stunt during the opening of "Virginia City," 1940, which Steven Spielberg lifted for the truck-chase in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." I really want this dude to sit down and watch the buffalo stampede in "How the West Was Won" and claim it's "weirdly obligatory."

The comparison between Peckinpah and Woo doesn't make sense beyond a cursory view, either. Yeah, they both employed highly stylized violence. But the way they employed it, and how, is completely different. Woo staged action like a classical ballet. Peckinpah staged action like a street fight (even when it didn't make sense to do so, eg: "Junior Bonner.") There are long, unbroken tracking shots in "Hard Boiled" that Peckinpah would never touch, and not solely because of aesthetics. There's also (and this is a big "also") meaning behind Peckinpah's use of violence, whereas there's really none in Woo's.

Not sure how much influence "The Wild Bunch" had (mostly due to its wobbly box office and changing runtime). It might have had a big personal impact on one individual filmmaker or another, but I don't see a lot of Peckinpah's style in other films from that period, or even later --- except in the commercial sense of including exploitation elements in a mainstream movie. That's visible all over the place in the two decades after "Wild Bunch" was released.  

If we want to talk influence, it's all about Leone and Eastwood. The shit they did 60 years ago is still visible in recent movies (again: "Taken," "John Wick," and "Nobody").

The machine gun style of "Rambo" can be seen in movies that predate "The Wild Bunch" by a number of years, particularly "Django" (1966), but also in "Vera Cruz" (1954) and "The Professionals" (1966). After Peckinpah, there's "The Outlaw Josie Wales" (1976).
