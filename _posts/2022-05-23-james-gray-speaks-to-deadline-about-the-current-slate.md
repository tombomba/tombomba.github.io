title: "James Gray speaks to Deadline about the current slate"
description: "I dunno. He's not wrong, but he's still wrong."

In a [short video](https://deadline.com/video/armageddon-time-james-gray-cannes-film-festival-box-office-streaming/), director James Gray covers box office and streaming content, film festivals and award shows, and loosely describes why, to paraphrase, "studios should be able to lose money on art specialty divisions." Gray just debuted his latest at a major international film festival. I am me, sitting in a small room in my boxer shorts, and in no position to tell him what's what. But while he's smart and articulate here, and makes good conventional sense, he is only ["correct"](https://twitter.com/SeanFennessey/status/1528526055916466176) under the narrowest of terms. I find his viewpoint weirdly insular, more reflective of a twitchy and defensive film culture.

Gray argues that major studios alienated part of their audience when they gave the theatrical space over to broad based genre flicks. In turn, people lost the habit of going to the movies. He suggests smaller films could be an investment in the theatrical experience. Studios should be willing to lose money on them in the short term. Nothing wrong with superheroes. They're fine. But decidedly uncommercial films might expand the audience overall. What we have now, with narrow appeal and shrinking attendance, makes movies less culturally relevant. Gray cites Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather" and Ang Lee's "The Ice Storm" to bolster portions of his argument.

 He begins by saying, "Theatrical is essential." Right there I could stop and write an entirely separate rebuttal, because...to whom does he think it's essential? Can't be the vaguely theater-going public of our collective imagination. Their failure to show up is the whole problem, right? The underlying idea---that the theatrical experience is core to the medium---is often expressed by specialists, and taken in stride, while they pontificate about cinema as religion, the theater as its church. The kinda thing you might hear from #filmtwitter bros and Letterboxd dorks (or Hollywood directors, anticipating the backend, watching movies in Los Angeles and New York, and drinking at Cannes and Venice and Toronto). You must be a real _afici√≥n,_ a fetishist who rambles on about film stock and aspect ratios, or one of the cloistered few, another industry bobblehead or scattered academic, to believe in the movie theater as "essential."

Phew. _Cinema._ Do I really need to genuflect at the altar of the silver screen to have a good time? Dip my fingers into a bowl of popcorn butter and solemnly make the hi-sign to pass an arbitrary shibboleth? I just wanna go to the movies. Or watch them at home. Fill my soul with high art. Or kill an evening. Theatrical may be essential to the select, but it isn't to most. A commercial artist should go where the audience lives, and not, ya know, necessarily force them into a windowless room.

Next: "If you look at the streaming movies that do the best, they are the movies that come out in theaters first. So that should tell you something." Yes. It tells me theatrical releases get an unholy amount of support from their studios, in terms of bookings and advertising. It doesn't, I don't think, say much else.
