A [trailer link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofnXPwUPENo), for the perpetually late and terminally uninformed. Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman, looking young and fresh, in the leads. A buncha A-listers, significantly older, and somehow less interesting, surround them. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson ("PTA"), the Patron Saint of Letterboxd. Distributed by MGM. Goes wide this December, meaning most won't see it until January next year.

Now you know everything there is to know and you can decide for yourself if it's worth a trip to the theater.
