<p>That page was no good. Try another?</p>

<ul class="404">
{% assign random_list = site.posts | sample: 3 -%}
{% for p in random_list -%}
  <li><a href="{{ p.url | prepend: site.url }}">{{ p.title | smartify }}</a> &mdash; {{ p.excerpt | strip_html | strip | normalize_whitespace | smartify }}</li>
{% endfor -%}
</ul>

<p>If you're still lost, check out posts from <a href="{{ site.posts.first.date | date: '/%Y/%m/' }}">this month</a> or <a href="{{ site.posts.first.date | date: '/%Y/' }}">this year</a>. If that doesn't help, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?l=&q=troubleday&src=typd">gimme a shout</a> on social media.
