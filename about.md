There are quite a few critics online who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This website is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express ideas I don't see routinely expressed.

My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around New York University's cinema studies program before I "dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing various forms of digital media.

_{{ site.title }}_ is intentionally basic, a sorta mental note to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. The name is a loose reference to essays by Pauline Kael and Jeffrey Sconce.

The site was built on an ancient Macintosh using Jekyll, Atom, and Pixelmator, while listening to KCRW Los Angeles.
