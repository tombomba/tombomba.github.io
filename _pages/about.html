{% capture bio %}
This website is my thousand-piece puzzle on the dining room table, my model kit in the den, my handmade canoe in the garage. I began working on it years ago, to join what seemed vital online conversation, and return now in fits and starts.

My name is Tom Bomba. I once flirted with NYU's cinema studies program but ran once I heard words like _filmic_ and _split diopter_ around campus. My interest in movies remains with writing, with story and character, and not with _mise-en-sc√®ne._

_{{ site.title }}_ is intentionally basic, the design a mental note to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. The name is a loose reference to Mark Fisher's old blog _K-Punk._ The icon is a riff on James Rosenquist's painting _Pink Condition._

Everything here was made using Nova and Pixelmator, while listening to KCRW Los Angeles.
