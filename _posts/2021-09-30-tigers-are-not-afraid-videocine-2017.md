The film, produced in Mexico, and originally "Vuelven" (literally "They Return"), centers on two children living in a ghost town created by narco violence. El Shine leads a group of street kids, imagining himself a gang leader but behaving more often as a tiny parent. He and his pals steal whatever they need and sleep wherever they can find a squat. Estrella joins them after she's orphaned. She is quite literally haunted by victims of the local cartel, and believes she's been granted three wishes, as in a storybook. The opening introduces a main plot and a couple subplots, which automatically makes the film more ambitious than most.

Unfortunately, "Tigers Are Not Afraid" never becomes greater than the sum of its parts. A crime story focuses on a missing cell phone, one Shine pickpocketed and some goons want returned. It's about as bland as it sounds, because the bad guys are stock issue movie thugs (albeit thugs who often point guns at small children). The supernatural elements plaguing Estrella are mostly spooky voices and desiccated corpses. Standard stuff, and curiously separate from the rest; nobody else realizes she can see and hear the dead.

The problem lies in both concept and execution. "Tigers" fails because it attempts to cross light fantasy with graphic brutality. The fantasy is too light, having little effect on the story. The brutality is too much, and too often. I'm old enough to remember when killing little kids on screen was considered to be in bad taste, not to mention highly manipulative. The reality of cartel driven murder is too ugly to be addressed this way, with a sorta faux magical realism, with small whispers and CGI animations. At least not without becoming grotesque in an unintended way.
