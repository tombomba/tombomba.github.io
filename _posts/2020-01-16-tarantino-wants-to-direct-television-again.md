It'll never happen but wouldn't that be something?

Quentin [says](https://deadline.com/2020/01/quentin-tarantino-oscar-nominations-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-star-trek-bounty-law-tv-series-1202829629/) he wrote 5 episodes of "Bounty Law," the fictional show featured in his recent "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," and plans to direct them. Where and when remain to be seen.

Remember Tarantino lays claim to a lotta things. He's spoken, over the years, about the as-yet-unproduced "Kill Bill 3." He's expressed a desire to write and direct a horror movie (alongside a rumor New Line actively courted him for a "Friday the 13th" sequel). More recently, he successfully pitched a "Star Trek" movie to Paramount but remains uninvolved in the franchise. Now this, a new-but-old show.

"Bounty Law" is meant to be traditional television western, in the style of "Have Gun, Will Travel" and "The Rifleman." When Tarantino says xxx, he's right. There's more story in these old 20 or 40 minute shows than most contemporary movies.
