{% capture bio %}
Originally, I wanted to make a movie site as an answer to the more shilly fan blogs. Then a more general audience arts and culture thing, akin to a _Hyperallergic_ or _Elephant._ Or maybe, I thought, just a media diary, a sorta amateur _K-Punk_ for the uninitiated. Detailed, rambling posts, spun out into more and more tangents. Digital life, old westerns, older novels, new science fiction, dead journalism, 8 bit games, lo-fi art... Simply talk about what was good when it was good, what's meaningful now.
