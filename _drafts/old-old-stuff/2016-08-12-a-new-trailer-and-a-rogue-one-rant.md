The "Rogue One" [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/frdj1zb9sMY) dropped last night during the Rio Olympics coverage. A few shots contain material from last May's [teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wji-BZ0oCwg), but there's also new character-based dialogue and close-ups. Some moments hint at gritty action and dark violence. The payoff is a single shot of Darth Vader, breathing over the soundtrack.

I watched, I sighed, I shrugged.

"Rogue One" is a new adventure in old territory. It features another story about plucky heroes fighting galactic villains over a planet-busting weapon. Just like "Star Wars," "Return of the Jedi," and "The Force Awakens." I don't know whether this universe is narratively shallow or simply unexplored. I'm not sure anyone at LucasFilm knows either. After a half dozen films, they can't get away from the Skywalkers and Death Stars.

There's little doubt "Rogue One" will play well, despite recent whispers of script [trouble](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rogue-one-drama-writer-tony-916695). Yet I wonder how many installments Disney can churn out before the audience drifts away. Year over year, what was special will become commonplace.

This trailer delivers everything I'd expect from "a Star Wars story," and maybe that's a problem.
