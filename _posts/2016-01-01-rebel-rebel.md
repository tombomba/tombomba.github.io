The "Rogue One" [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frdj1zb9sMY) dropped last night during the Rio Olympics coverage. A few shots contain material from last May's [teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wji-BZ0oCwg), but there's also new character-based dialogue and close-ups. Some moments hint at gritty action and dark violence. The payoff is a shot of Darth Vader, breathing over the soundtrack.

I watched, I sighed, I shrugged.

"Rogue One" is a new adventure in old territory. It features another story about plucky heroes fighting galactic villains over a planet-busting weapon. Just like "Star Wars," "Return of the Jedi," and "The Force Awakens." I can't tell whether this universe is narratively shallow or simply unexplored. I'm not sure anyone at LucasFilm can tell either. After a half dozen films, they can't get away from Skywalkers and Death Stars.

There's little doubt "Rogue One" will hit with audiences, despite recent whispers of [script trouble](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rogue-one-drama-writer-tony-916695). Yet I wonder how many installments Disney can churn out before people drift away. Year over year, what was special will become commonplace.

This trailer delivered everything I expected from a "Star Wars Story," and maybe that's a problem.
