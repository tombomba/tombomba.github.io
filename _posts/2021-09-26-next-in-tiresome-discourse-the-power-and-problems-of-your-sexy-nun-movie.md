title: "Next in tiresome discourse: The power and problems of your sexy nun movie"

Too many contemporary critics are smug when they should be thoughtful. Case in point: The [film twit reaction](https://twitter.com/search?q=benedetta%20protest&src=typed_query) to a small protest outside the NYFF showing of "Benedetta," Paul Verhoeven's [lesbian nun movie](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=verhoeven+benedetta+trailer).

A dozen Catholics from a right-leaning fringe group made noise on a Sunday afternoon. Right outside a movie theater. There was a megaphone. One guy played drums. A sign read, "Why the endless insults to Jesus?" Another, "I'm Catholic. Stop attacking my faith."

First, who cares? It was an insignificant rally, and quickly became [accidental publicity](https://twitter.com/TheNYFF/status/1442193742396465155) for the film. Nobody blocked access to the venue. There wasn't any violence. (The middlebrows still appreciate peaceful protests, don't they?) Second, I'm a tired of thoughtless dunks on social media. Fringe is fringe, sure, and it's easy to [point and laugh](https://twitter.com/TomiLaffly/status/1442202169386536961), but not every spiritual person with a cardboard sign is a member of a [hate group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_for_the_Defense_of_Tradition,_Family_and_Property). They may sometimes have a point.

If a prominent European director released a movie that treated Islam or Judaism as a cheap magic show, as a source of prurient interest, I imagine these same critics would demand retractions and apologies. They wouldn't hesitate to beat their own social media pulpits in self-righteous fury. But when it comes to Catholicism, fuck it, there's no problems, right?

One stringer inadvertently raised a good point about the film when [she said](https://twitter.com/TomiLaffly/status/1442198523198337025), "Bought my tix as soon as I heard itâ€™s a sexy nun movie---can't wait." She meant to be clever, if not superior, but there's a whole worldview packed in there.

If Verhoeven had made the same story about two priests, it never would have sold to a distributor. Nobody would be gleefully posting about it, because contemporary film culture doesn't champion gay men the same way it does gay women. If "Benedetta" were an earnest film about religious life, there would be far less public interest. The veneer of warm and fuzzy politics is suspect then, if not a sham.

Verhoeven, for his part, has made half a career from turning trashy exploitation into commercial art. That should tell us something here. He's never been as much about empowerment as much as he's been about tits on screen (God bless &rsquo;em).

"Benedetta's" draw is exactly and totally that 'sexy nun,' a fetish object, a sub-genre, a Halloween costume. She is almost sui generis, appearing pre-loaded with meaning, the kind debated in freshman film seminars and obscure academic journals, and most of her representations couldn't be called an aesthetic or moral good, no matter how much critical randos may want them to be.

So, I'm tired of lazy jabs at Catholicism just because. And I'm tired of critics who'd rather be glib than curious or empathetic. And I'm tired of the political gamesmanship that surrounds so much of film culture. The discourse around this film is already bad, and it's barely begun.
