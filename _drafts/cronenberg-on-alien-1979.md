> It has no metaphysics, no philosophy. The creature winds up as a man in a crocodile suit who chases a bunch of people around a room. I think that my own films do a lot more in touching a deep seated nerve, more than the simple reaction that you donâ€™t want a crocodile to eat you. 'Alien' was just a $300,000 B-movie with a $10 million budget.
