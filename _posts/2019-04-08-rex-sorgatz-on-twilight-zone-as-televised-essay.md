I don't agree with the premise---there are good reasons why early television was loud, dumb, and stagebound---but as short takes go, this is well articulated and worth considering:

> If you go back and watch the original, you'll see how disinterested the series is in being good fiction. The writing was forced; the acting, hammy; the direction, heavy-handed. The show was borderline corny, and this seemed intentional. _The Twilight Zone_ was a masterpiece because it was the only show that prioritized the idea over the execution. Today's critics (a group that now comprises anyone with an HBO Go password) will say to this: HUGE MISTAKE. "The only goal is telling a good story," as Spielberg surely must have said, in this dimension or another. Fine, whatever, I'll add the quote to my vision board. But what if the story impinges on the idea? What if tidy endings and naturalistic acting and all the other conventions of "good television" run counter to your goals? What if you are more interested in writing an essay than in telling a story?
