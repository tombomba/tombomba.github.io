Two seconds into a four minute [video](https://deadline.com/video/armageddon-time-james-gray-cannes-film-festival-box-office-streaming/) and I want to stop him right there. Essential to whom, exactly? It can't be the vaguely theater-going public of our collective imagination. Their failure to show up is the whole problem, right? The underlying idea at play---that the theatrical experience is core to the medium---is often expressed by insiders. Industry (directors!) and adjacent (critics!) who only see films at studio previews and press screenings, or between hobnobs at international festivals. 

Back in the world, "theatrical is essential" lives within the steady province of #filmtwitter bros and Letterboxd dorks, self-appointed _afici√≥ns_ rambling on about cinema as religion, about movie theaters as church. Given the reality of premium tickets, block booking, noisy patrons, limited matinees, expensive concessions, cell phones, ubiquitous DCP---in short, the soul crushing unappeal of the dead mall megaplex---you must be a true believer indeed to see a movie theater as essential.

Phew! _Cinema._ Do I really need to genuflect before the silver screen to have a good time? Dip my fingers into a bowl of anointed popcorn butter and pass an arbitrary shibboleth? I just wanna go to the movies. Or watch them at home. Fill my soul. Or kill an evening. Theatrical may be an absolute to some, but it isn't to most. A commercial artist should go where the audience lives, I think, and not force them into a windowless room.
