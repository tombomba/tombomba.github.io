"That he made his villain an icon of the L.A.P.D. before the Rodney King tape was released, and then pushed it even harder in his script for Strange Days...What happened to blockbuster movies saying [fuck the police](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/terminator-2-commentary-policing/) as hard as James Cameron?"

Stewart-Ahn can't seem to [recall](https://web.archive.org/web/20220604064427/https://twitter.com/somebadideas/status/1532899847048683520) a time before September, 2001. When the country leaned right, but not hard right. He doesn't remember, or never knew, what happened in Los Angeles from roughly 1978--98.

Back then, the [L.A.P.D. gunned down a single mom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Eula_Love) in broad daylight. They instituted a policy that led to the [arrest of 50,000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Hammer_(1987)). Their brutality was [caught on tape](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Rodney+King+video). Years later,  [Rampart](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rampart-scandal) broke. Cameron lived and worked in L.A. during this period. So when he chose police officers for his villains, it wasn't prescience. It was a reflection of what was already in the street and on the news.

Sure, there's a political angle to "Judgment Day." But the new terminator could have taken a different form without altering the movie's larger story. The character then is nothing more than a costume. A jab that might have been a hook, at least in a film with more serious intentions.

Film critic Bilge Ebiri [replied](https://twitter.com/BilgeEbiri/status/1533295627064451074) to Stewart-Ahn, saying, "It's funny how people have forgotten there was an actual controversy over how Cameron made the U.S. military the bad guys in Avatar."

There was no controversy, unless you pay mind to fringe websites and cranky periodicals. (Or, for some reason, wish to lend their ideas credibility by referencing an [imaginary beef](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Movies/politics-avatar-conservatives-attack-movies-political-messaging/story?id=9484885) more than a decade later.)

"Avatar's" politics were implicit; you can't write about one state invading another without being political. Yet the treatment was superficial, the politics never the focus. Just as with "T2," Cameron made it easy to ignore the message and enjoy the spectacle, rendering the movie's positions inconsequential.

This may be his lasting influence on the genre. "Starship Troopers," "War of the Worlds", "Winter Soldier," and "Fury Road," among other sci-fantasies,  also combined unsophisticated stories with empty politics. Years on, audiences still engage with the action, but not so much with the message.
