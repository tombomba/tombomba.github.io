Greta Gerwig's "Little Women" left confused me for the first hour, and by the end of the second, disappointed. I had gone in cold, without having read the original novel that the film is based on, or seen any of the many adaptions made for screen and TV. This turned out to be a mistake, at least as far as a working introduction to Louisa May Alcott's story, because this newest incarnation assumes a familiarity with the source material.

"Little Women" is, of course, the vaunted coming-of-age-tale of Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy, four sisters living in 19th century Concorde, Massachusetts. Isn't that nice? A boilerplate description that tells you almost nothing, especially the 'coming-of-age' part. Everyone comes of age but not everyone discovers themselves. "Little Women" is a story of self discovery.



Not being familiar with the book or previous adaptations, I was very confused for most of the first hour, as Gerwig takes a scattershot approach and frantically tosses 30 second scene after 30 second scene at the audience. Who are these people? Why should I care? Are they really gonna be this cloying and precious and saintly for the entire film?

I liked the flashback structure but it also posed a problem given the limits of film, as a medium, and the actresses themselves --- people look very different between, say, the ages of 13 and 20, but the movie can't acknowledge this, so instead I was left constantly re-orienting myself with every new scene, trying to decide if it took place in the older present or the sentimental past.

Most of the movie seems at odds with itself. Gerwig wants to be true to Alcott's original fantasy but layers a confusing modern viewpoint on top of it. I don't think that works particularly well, especially around the male characters and any question of love. The romances, in particular, give way to a plots about female ambition. But I suspect those romances are the largest appeal of the book, in the back and forth melodrama of will-they-or-won't-they. Here, though, Laurie and the Immigrant Guy are so briefly sketched that I couldn't believe it when they declared their love for Jo or she for them. (It didn't help that the actors involved shared no particular chemistry.)

Although I must admit the very meta ending was clever -- but almost too clever. Gerwig's sly attempt to have her cake and eat it too. One scene about Jo remaining determined and independent matched against another in which she gives herself over to love and marriage.

Part of my confusion came from the initial scenes with Amy. I didn't understand why her sisters left her at home and I didn't understand why she takes such nasty revenge on Jo --- because it's not clear the character is supposed to be a very young girl. I mean, Pugh is an adult woman and looks it so her character's behavior seems almost psychotic.

I sought out the 1994 Armstrong adaptation, where Amy is played by a 12 year old Kirsten Dunst, and suddenly everything made sense.

My biggest problem is that Gerwig assumes the audience is already familiar with the material. I found large parts of her movie non-sensical, and after seeing the story played in a more traditional, linear fashion, I think her crazy structure undermines much of the narrative in the latter half of the story.

Armstrong also paid a lot more attention to Laurie and Friedrich, and deepening their relationship with Jo, so that helped quite a bit, too.

I might have liked this a more if I hadn't already seen "Portrait of a Lady on Fire" and "The Nightingale," both period pieces about the lives of women, written and directed by women, and more successful in achieving their aims.
