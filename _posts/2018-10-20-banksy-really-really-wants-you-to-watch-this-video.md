A coupla weeks ago "Girl with Balloon" sold at auction for $1.4 million and when the gavel came down, a gizmo housed in the frame [shredded](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/sotheby-s-banksy-ed-as-painting-self-destructs-live-at-auction) half of it. This week Banksy [revealed](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpDMo26h3Cu/?hl=en&taken-by=banksy) the prank didn't quite come off; he intended to destroy the entire painting but the mechanism jammed. Oh, well.

"Shred the Love" is another promotional exercise, and Banksy another brand with a new ad. It's intended as a jab at the market, I guess, but the message doesn't land because it's impossible to effectively satirize something while benefitting from it.

The best part is the look on the auctioneer's face. It's the same look a school principal has when his worst student misbehaves during assembly---again.
