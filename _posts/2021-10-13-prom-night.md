It has a cool poster, so that's something, right? But the actual experience is poor. "Prom Night" borrows heavily from better movies, and doesn't offer anything new in the borrowing. The script takes concepts from "Black Christmas," "Carrie," and "Halloween," and drops them nearly unchanged into the middle of the movie. So we get this ersatz version of things, paler and dumber than in the original sources---a lunatic escaped from an asylum, breathy telephone calls from the killer, mean girls conspiring to ruin the prom queen's big night. The rest is an unending series of whys. Why is Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie? Why does Leslie Nielsen's character disappear? Why include a sweet, youthful romance? Why is the villain dressed like a stock photo burglar? Why is the school so lame, and every kid a square? Why why why?

Watching "Prom Night" turned my face into a [reaction meme](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Confused+Reporter+Jonathan+Swan&iax=images&ia=images).
