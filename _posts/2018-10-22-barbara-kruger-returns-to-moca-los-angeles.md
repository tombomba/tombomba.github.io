Her mural "Untitled (Questions)" is back on the wall at 152 N. Central Ave., Little Tokyo, Downtown, where it debuted nearly 30 years ago. Installation was [completed](https://twitter.com/MOCAlosangeles/status/1053755357686751233) last weekend and will run through November, 2020.

The [work](https://www.wikiart.org/en/barbara-kruger/untitled-questions-1991) features an American flag design with large, block letters asking a series of 9 questions:

> WHO IS BEYOND THE LAW? WHO IS BOUGHT AND SOLD? WHO IS FREE TO CHOOSE? WHO DOES TIME? WHO FOLLOWS ORDERS? WHO SALUTES LONGEST? WHO PRAYS LOUDEST? WHO DIES FIRST? WHO LAUGHS LAST?

This was [pointed stuff](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-barbara-kruger-moca-mural-20181018-story.html) during the early 90s and the time of Bush the Elder, The First Gulf War, and the AIDs crisis, when CNN and Time magazine defined the media landscape and nobody spoke truth to power at this scale or in this way.

Today, it's dated. Kruger's mural is a giant meme. It's a tweet on steroids.

I like Kruger. I like "You are Not Yourself" and "Your Body is a Battleground," pointed work that exists outside historical context and whose complaints aren't so completely tired. I even liked ["Questions"](https://www.wikiart.org/en/barbara-kruger/untitled-questions-1991) when it debuted, back during the First Gulf War in 1991.
