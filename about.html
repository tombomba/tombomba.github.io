<i>{{ site.title }}</i> is about American mythology through media. The rough borders of my interest stretch from the Mississippi to the Pacific, up through the Yukon, down to Panama, and maybe a little further.

My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around NYU before I "dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing digital media.

So, yes. This is another blog about movies and books, but one where pop art is viewed through an intentionally limited, geographic lens.

The site was created on a Macintosh using Jekyll, Atom, and Pixelmator while listening to KCRW Los&nbsp;Angeles.
