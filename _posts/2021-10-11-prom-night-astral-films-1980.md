title: "Prom Night (Astral Films, 1980)"
---

Casually borrows from better movies, such as "Black Christmas," "Carrie," and "Halloween," and is so blandly produced it makes the "Friday the 13" sequels look absolutely artful. Features the lamest high school in the movies. Curtis attends prom dressed like somebody's grandmother. The male actors could all double for Willie Ames. The killer is dressed like a stock photo burglar. Outside one brief moment at the very end, it's dull as heck.
