I'm old enough and jaded enough that the Academy should never surprise me but every year they do. They were spoiled for choice and still made some of the dumbest, blandest selections possible. Still, despite obvious exclusions, there's 4-5 solid movies in Picture, Documentary, and Foreign. I can't remember the last time that happened, or looked forward, as I do now, to award night. (Maybe it was 2013? Maybe.)

Like, zero noms for Sandler or Murphy but 2 for Scarjo.

11 noms for one of the worst movies of the year.

There's Todd again, sitting in somebody else's chair.

Screenplay continues to be used as a "runners up" dumping ground.

Yet despite obvious omissions, there's 4-5 solid movies in Picture, Documentary, and Foreign (aka "International"). Can't remember the last time that happened.
