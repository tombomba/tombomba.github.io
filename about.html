{% capture bio %}
My name is Tom Bomba. I'm a rando on the internet who likes movies, novels, comics, and video games with a sense of place. Give me Lone Pine or Warsong Gulch. Give me the Salinas Valley. Monument Valley. Locations you can live in and dream in and come back to. Then I want story and more story. A protagonist with values, good or bad. Art or trash. High culture or low. Doesn't matter. I want to talk about something with something to say.{% endcapture %}
