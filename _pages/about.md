There are quite a few crix out there who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This website is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express things I don't see routinely expressed.

My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around NYU's cinema studies program before I "dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing digital media.

_{{ site.title }}_ is half culture-blog and half media-diary, with a focus on work that carries unusual perspectives. The name references Claire Denis' 2001 vampire flick "Trouble Every&nbsp;Day."

The site was created on a Macintosh using Jekyll, Atom, and Pixelmator while listening to KCRW Los Angeles. The bomber icon was created by Adrien Coquet for the Noun Project.

If you'd like to get in touch, [track me down](https://twitter.com/search?l=&q=tom%20bomba%20troubleday&src=typd) on social media.
