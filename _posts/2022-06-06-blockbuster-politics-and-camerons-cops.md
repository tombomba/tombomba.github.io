Aaron Stewart-Ahn [gushes](https://twitter.com/somebadideas/status/1532899847048683520): "That he made his villain an icon of the LAPD before the Rodney King tape was released, and then pushed it even harder in his script for Strange Days... What happened to blockbuster movies saying [fuck the police](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/terminator-2-commentary-policing/) as hard as James Cameron?"

This in reference to "Terminator 2" and "Strange Days," films released in the early and mid-1990s.

Stewart-Ahn can't seem to recall a time before September, 2001. When the country leaned right, but not hard right. When our system was ugly, but not this ugly. He doesn't remember, or never knew, what happened in Los Angeles when Cameron was making his movies.

Like the time [the L.A.P.D gunned down a single mom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Eula_Love) in broad daylight. Or when they instituted procedures leading to the [arrest of 50,000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Hammer_(1987)) over a 3 year period. There's an arc to the state violence in Los Angeles. It became nationally visible in [May, 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King), and again with  [Rampart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_scandal).

This is the city where James Cameron wrote his scripts. So when he chose an L.A. police officer as the villain for "Judgement Day," it wasn't prescient. It was a reflection of what was already in the news and on the street.

There's a political angle, sure, but it's a weak one. You could easily imagine the T-1000 in a different form without changing the larger story. The character then is nothing more than a costume, a singular figure with one thought behind him. That he looks like a cop is jab that could have been a hook in a film with more serious intentions.

Bilge Ebiri [attempts](https://twitter.com/BilgeEbiri/status/1533295627064451074) to add to Stewart-Ahn's point, I guess, by offering, "It's funny how people have forgotten there was an actual [controversy](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Movies/politics-avatar-conservatives-attack-movies-political-messaging/story?id=9484885) over how Cameron made the US military the bad guys in AVATAR."

But "Avatar" is similar to the sci-fantasy blockbusters that preceded it, going back to Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers" and Spielberg's "War of the Worlds." The movie's politics are implicit, because you can't write a story about one state invading another without being "political." Yet the treatment is superficial, never the focus, just as it was with "Terminator 2." Cameron made it too easy to ignore the message and enjoy the spectacle, rendering his movie's positions inconsequential.

Keeping this trend alive may be Cameron's lasting cultural impact. The blockbusters that followed "Avatar," such as "Winter Solider" and "Fury Road," peddled in similar lip service. Political themes are again there but not there, identifiable but meaningless.
