Originally, I wanted to do a movie blog. Then I thought, something more focused around genre. Paracinema, maybe. But I discovered even the the nichiest of fandom niches has too many rabid voices, all of them blending into a dull cacophony across a dozen socials.

My name is Tom Bomba. I have no bylines or awards to show you. I am neither journalist nor critic, and I've never been on staff. I am another rando on the internet, starting from nowhere, and wanting to speak.

<i>{{ site.title }}</i> is a site about the west. About American mythology through media. The rough borders of my interest stretching from the Mississippi to the Pacific, up through the Yukon, down to Panama, and maybe a little further.

So, yes, finally, a site about movie and books, but also art and design and advertising, viewed through a geographic lens.

I hope you enjoy it.
