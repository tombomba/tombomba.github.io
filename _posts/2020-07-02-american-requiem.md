["Love Is the Message, and the Message Is Death"](https://www.moca.org/program/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death) is a collection of found images, news broadcasts, Getty archives, dashcam reels, and video clips, carefully edited and arranged, set to Kanye's ["Ultalight Beam,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oHdAA3AqnE) and made into a work of extraordinary art by Arthur Jafa.

Jafa is a cinematographer and artist who has worked with Spike Lee and Julie Dash. This particular film was acquired by the Hirshhorn Museum along with the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2018. It played in [virtual screenings](https://hirshhorn.si.edu/news/press-release/love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death-streamed-june-26-28/) at 13 museums last weekend. Seek it out once the world re-opens if you missed these shows.

"Love Is the Message, and the Message Is Death" is a Black history lesson in 7 minutes and thirty seconds. It depicts private joy and public brutality, the famous with the obscure. There is plenty of shocking violence, and you'll recognize some of the news footage and remember when you saw it. Most is all too recent.

Yet you could also make a photo book from Jafa's collection, as each juxtaposition is more striking than the last. His genius lies in the timing and the edit, in the layering of sound and image, in showing Black pride right alongside Black pain, and in achieving his effects using found objects and visual detritus. The contradiction between the images is the point; it fuels both empathy and rage.

One moment will stay with me: A close-up of a young woman riding silently in a car, her expression unchanging. Her gaze starts with the camera and runs past for a mile and a year, and keeps going, her face the face of someone who has seen too much in too short a time. She needn't speak to communicate her truth.

"Love Is the Message, and the Message Is Death" is like that, too. It says something real without using words.
