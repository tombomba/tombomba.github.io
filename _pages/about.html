{% capture bio %}
Once upon a time, I said a lot of things here, on this page, to describe myself, because I wanted a lot of things. I wanted to create a movie site that would compete with the more shilly fan blogs. Then an arts site, something akin to a one man _Hyperallergic_ or _Elephant_ or _Bomb._ Or maybe, I thought, just riff, do a sorta amateur _K-Punk_ for the uninitiated. Post detailed, rambling conversations about old novels and new science fiction. Spin out into more and more tangents, wherever my interest took me. Digital life, dead journalism, classic games, indie work, _Mondo_ and _Hotwired,_ the failures of cyberpunk, of publishing, of Hollywood... Simply talk about what was good when it was good, what's meaningful and real now.
