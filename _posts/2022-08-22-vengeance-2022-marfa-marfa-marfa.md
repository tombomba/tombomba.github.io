Writer-director-star B.J. Novak played tourist in Texas a few years back, and the result is "Vengeance," a light comedy without good jokes, believable characters, or strong locations. His alter-ego Ben Manalowitz is a cynical writer who travels from New York to Texas for the funeral of a half-remembered fling, a woman curiously named Abilene. Meeting her family, Ben seizes on the idea of turning her death into a "Serial"-style podcast event. He thinks it'll boost his career. It probably will.

Novak's script mostly peddles in regional stereotypes, and the Texas presented here could be anywhere (and it is: the movie was principally shot in New Mexico). Outside of Ben and his New York producer, the characters are broad caricatures, all big hair and long drawls. The actors are stuck with material that too often sounds like "Hee Haw" crossed with "Saturday Night Live." 

After the funeral, Ben stays with Abilene's family, asks a lot of questions, and gathers material for his pod. Older brother Ty believes Abilene to have been murdered and pushes Ben to help him investigate (this is his one character trait). Two other sisters are Paris and Kansas City, who want to be famous for being famous. The family's youngest is called El Stupido, but as Ty explains, "it's okay because he doesn't speak Spanish." Granny launches into an impromptu history lesson over dinner, and the payoff to the bit requires Ben to be ignorant of the Alamo. Novak is a Harvard educated writer, playing a Harvard educated writer. These are the jokes.

When Ben begins to go native and attempts to describe the countryside for an episode of his podcast, he finds he can't. Instead he stumbles over his words and yells "It's beautiful!" into the mic. Anyone who has visited Texas, or seen it in better movies, or read about it by way of the state's countless authors, well, they already understand the draw. But Novak doesn't attempt to meet any sort of cultural bar with his setting. His character's incoherence is too superficial an expression for, frankly, such a storied place.

Ashton Kutcher plays a local record producer who knew Abilene while she was alive. Kutcher tries hard to give an authentic performance and he mostly succeeds. He's the only actor in the film who sounds as if he means what he says. Unfortunately, huge chunks of his dialogue are overwritten, and he sometimes comes across like an Aaron Sorkin character delivering a TED talk; the pretentious bullshit gradually becomes a form of white noise.

The record producer lives on a ranch outside Marfa, a place in the real world with a reputation as an artist's retreat. (There's a famously fake Prada store there, a little commentary on location-as-branding). Marfa is the rough equivalent of San Miguel de Allende or Provo or Aspen---small towns transformed into tourist destinations by outside money. Putting Marfa in your down-home comedy is a little like setting a movie in Fresno and shooting it in Beverly Hills.

The climax consists of teary monologues punctuated by violence. The movie wants us to believe Ben finally sees the value of Abilene's life and has come to mourn her death. Such an emotional beat depends on the audience's investment in this non-character character, in a woman who was fridged before the story began. Novak never cared enough to write her as real, she barely registers beyond the plot, so why should we care now that the movie is ending?

Both B.J. Novak and his fictional counterpart went to Texas and treated people and place as fodder for a vanity project. Ben eventually realized he was a schmuck for doing it. Novak never did. This hangs a strange meta on the back half of the movie, as we watch the main character exhibit a glimmer more self-awareness than the person who created him.
