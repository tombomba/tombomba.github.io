title: "Rashomon"
read: 2021-11-30
score: 4/5
---
- I mean, it's good but very ostentatious. 
- Kurosawa going for the silent movie feel and please. 
- Plus all those strings on the soundtrack. 
- Interesting because the stories don't simply repeat details with small variations. Each tale is markedly different, and each sequence relates new information to the audience.
- Also interesting in the way the characters don't exaggerate their own deeds to any great degree in an attempt to protect their own ego (well, maybe the bandit does). 
- Baby appears out of nowhere lol.
- Extremely bold then as now to end on an ambiguous note, which I liked. 
- Check out Ebert "Great Movies" entry---he doesn't know what to say, either, and resorts to talking about production details.

title: "The Last Duel"
read: 2021-11-29
score: 2/5

- Extremely tiring. Lotsa bad acting but maybe a couple of decent performances. (Naturally, film twitter blows this aspect out of proportion.) 
- The production design and costumes were ace, and the CGI was unsurprisingly terrible (lol that same shot of Notre Dame under construction, used multiple times). 
- Notice I haven't said anything about the story yet.

title: "Foxy Brown"
read: 2021-11-29
score: 2/5
---
- Grier is strangely *not* at the center of the movie. Instead, it's her boyfriend (a cop) and her brother (a snitch) who drive the  narrative. 
- Wastes a lot of time setting up the boyfriend's backstory.
- Too many male characters, each of whom come and go at abritrary points, and Foxy doesn't have enough going on of her own. 
- The part where she infiltrates a gang of hookers is too reminiscent of "Coffy."
- The scene with the judge feels particularly false, even in the context of an exploitation film. 
- Although the last 5 minutes with the balls in a jar is pretty hardcore. 
- I saw this last week and can barely remember it. 
- Huuuuuuuge step down from "Coffy."

title: "Fort Apache, The Bronx"
read: 2021-11-28
score: 3/5
---
- Really false but gets by on star power and location. And that title card disclaimer. Yeesh!
- Starts off with Grier's homicidal whore killing 2 cops. She's the best thing in the movie.
- The rooftop murder is still shocking, but the movie doesn't really dive into it. Sure, there's a scene where Newman and Aiello, and a lotta dialogue and scenes built around Newman's choice to go rat or not, but it seems to me the focus is misplaced---it's on this one guy's qualms and not on the crime itself, or the kids, or a system that allows such a thing to happen virtually unchecked. 
- Whole film is episodic, and some episodes Meanders about half way through. 
- The standoff in the hospital is too frantic and action based for a movie like this, because it doesn't really want to be about pulling guns and busting down doors. Although I do like the twist that Newman's character killed the guy responsible for his girlfriend's murder (and Grier's hooker's death, too) before he knows the girlfriend is dead. 
- Corliss and Ebert said this one was full of every cop movie cliche possible, but it's hard for me to judge because the first time I saw it I was so young all the cliches seemed fresh. 
- They also said it looked like TV and I guess it does (Hill St Blues in particular) but otoh it's never as cheap looking as most of the cop shows from the period (Starsky and Hutch et al). 
- South Bronx in the 1981 is a helluva thing.

title: "The Big Bird Cage"
read: 2021-11-28
score: 3/5
---
- Trash exploitation, but some good moments or unintentional / intentional humor? 
- Pretty strong start with the band holding up the nightclub, with Sid Haig and TKTK thin chick carjacking a short escape. 
- Each of the characters has a distinct personality and there's multiple subplots, so win?
- All that revolutionary shit about getting "200 women" from the prison never really pays off, which is a shame because that would have been an interesting direction to take. 
- Too long for the debutante chick to meet Grier. 
- Likewise all the expositional fuss about the "big bird cage" and how dangerous it is, and the visual focus on it at the start. Like they introduce this stuff and it's pretty good detail and then they do absolutely nothing with it. 
- Goes a little too long, runs out of plot points to hit after the first hour. People I thought were major characters disappear for a long stretch. 
- Ending is interesting and nihilistic. They blow up the set and most of the characters die. (Even Grier, which was sorta shocking. I don't think the producers knews what they had in her.)

---
title: "Coffy"
read: 2021-11-27
score: 4/5
---
- Never quite understood the appeal of Grier until now. Like seeing Monroe for the first time in "All About Eve." 
- Has a layered social message but doesn't overkill it, and it's tied directly to the narrative. 
- There's a good and steady build up as Grier advances through the criminal underworld.
- Also a good early scene when the black cop rousts that white dude who is harassing Grier as she's on her way to work. Nice little reversal you don't see often. 
- I like the idea that she started out getting revenge for her sister but then later it's as if she's also getting revenge for the cop from her neighborhood and herself, too. 
- When Grier gives that speech about killing everybody along the drug chain, you know she'll do it, or at least try, and you know the politico boyfriend is involved, too. But it's still a shock at the end when he so callously throws her away to save himself. 
- I liked the final scene, this dude trying to worm his way out, and Grier hesistates until the white chick comes down the stairs and Grier knows he cheated. Then "blam!" No more balls. And she walks out. 

---
title: "Wrath of Man"
read: 2021-11-26
score: 2/5
---
- Interesting for the first hour, maybe? And fun when it has characters in it and mystery. 
- But then it turns into a procedural centered on LA criminal gangs, and I'm sorry but I've seen all that shit before (kudos tho for walking across Michael Mann territroy, unafraid of commparisons. That takes stones.)
- The heist is confusing (even though we see it 2-3 times). Why was Statham and his kid near the crime scene again?
- Scott Eastwood is a terrible actor and isn't nearly good enough to play the heavy heavy. 
- The final heist at the depot was okay. "Money Movers" was a better movie about this subject, nevermind the French original of this film (which I haven't seen). 
- Was the original 3 hours long? Becasuse it seems like Ritchie tried to pack a lot of plot into 2 hours and the movie is top heavy as a result. Very slow build up at the start (and that's the part that's actually interesting) and then runs rapidly ahead to cover all the bases. 
- Spends some much time with the crew of army robbers you almost forget about Statham. Whose story is this anyway?
- Dead kid is a boring motivator for the anti-hero.

https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/25/stellan-skarsgard-my-tips-for-fatherhood-dont-lie-even-about-santa-claus

This reads weirdly disingenuous to me---like another wealthy celeb trying to sound like a man of the people by pointing out obvious ills (and simultaneously dodging a charged interview question)

This isn't "we should improve society somewhat," either. Notice he doesn't offer alternatives or solutions. 

When he wants to make art, he stays in Europe. When he wants to make money, he comes to the U.S. 

This is a guy with an estimated net worth of $40-50 million, decrying a system he's directly benefitted from and telling us, "Gosh, isn't it just terrible?"

He's also wrong about THE GODFATHER, which was a highly anticipated studio movie based on a popular novel, and starring one of the most famous actors in the world. It was the very definition of a "big film" in its time.

title: "Body Double"
watched: 2021-11-24
score: 2/5
---
- Too much _much_ and very little payoff.
- All that titty and no rush. I've rarely seen blander attempts at eroticism on screen.
- There's 2 reviews on Letterboxd worth a look. One by Kael, another by some rando. 
- https://letterboxd.com/notpaulinekael/film/body-double/1/
- https://letterboxd.com/neilbahadur/film/body-double/1/
- I don't buy the shit about De Palma as "Brechtian ironist" or anything about the film being a critique of Hollywood. Because in his heart of hearts, De Palma loves this stuff too much to shit on it, even at a distance. If it is a critique, it's an obvious and timid one. Oh Hollywood is sleazy and there's no diff between hardcore porn and studio films? You don't say. But regardless, worth thinking about and worth pushing back against.
- Because my feeling has always been that De Palma is a pervert with a great eye, and unlike most perverts, he's unfraid to reveal his obsessions. 
- Agree with Kael that the lead actor is bland and De Palma is mostly going through the motions, and the only thing alive in it is Melanie Griffith's performance and personlity.
- The Vertigo and Rear Window stuff isn't lazy but it's uninspired and boring, especially as everybody in the audience knows exactly what De Palma is doing. There's no new ideas and no spin on old ideas. Claustrophobia over vertigo? Please.
- Rewatch. I don't know what I thought of this the first time, but this time I didn't enjoy it at all.

title: "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"
watched: 2021-11-24
score: ?/5
---
- Good movie, but watched a version with the lamer subtitles. 
- Seemed more disjointed this time around? And the themes more obvious/apparent. 
- Might be something I've seen one too many times so now it appears commonplace. 

---
title: "From Russia, With Love"
watched: 2021-11-22
score: 2/5
---
- From Russia, but without the Russians.
- Only one good sequence: After the gypsy camp fight, when Kerim takes Bond along to assassinate the man who's already tried to kill Kerim 3 times. The whole business with the painted ad on the side of the apartment building (for "Call Me Bwana," a romantic comedy with Bob Hope and Anita Eckberg). It's just exotic enough and thoroughly cold blooded as Bond helps Kerim commit murder. The problem is, of course, that this entire sequence literally has _nothing_ to do with the rest of the movie. It's a set piece for the sake of being a set piece and nothing more. 
- The sequence on the train, when Bond and Grant finally get down to it, is nice, but the movie takes too long in getting there.
- Another talking villain as Grant lays out SPECTRE's entire plan for Bond. 
- Still can't believe they inserted SPECTRE into these early Bond novels. Very silly. Very boring. 

---
title: "Dr. No"
watched: 2021-11-22
score: 3/5
---
- Brings back aloooooooot of memories. I haven't seen this in 30? 40? years. Good God. 
- Nicely simple detective story until the end. Honeychile even tells Bond on the beach, "I've never met a detective before" and Dr. No refers to him as "just another stupid policeman." 
- Muddled explanation of what No hopes to ultimately achieve and what Bond needs to do to stop him. Bond sorta investigates until No overplays his hand, then it's a pretty shitty action climax.
- Honey is much lesss interesting in the movie? Going on pure memory but there was at least _something_ to her character in the book beyond her introduction. 
- Talking villain as Dr. No tips Bond to the existence of SPECTRE at dinner. Like, why, dude? 
- Also I miss the silliness of Dr No being buried in literal bat shit.
- The reaaaaally fucked up the ending. The book is both more violent and more sexual (especially around Honey). Bond's entire capture and escape lacks Fleming's eye for detail (the description of the swamp on Crab Key, the "dragon," etc., and No's "mink lined prison," the hot and cold copper tubes out of the joint, Bond's struggle to stay conscious.)

---
title: "Benedetta"
watched: 2021-11-22
score: 2/5
---
- I found this really tiresome, because it never decides on a worldview. 
- If Benedetta is a faker, then most of the film is meaningless. Yet the script repeatedly hints that's the case, right up until the end. 
- Not an interesting investigation into either the nature of faith or illicit romance.
- Benedetta's lover is sorta a blank, underwritten character.
- Another movie that combines 2 or maybe 3 sub-genres into one with mixed results. 
- Each of these stories has been done before, and done in a more interesting way. (Lesbian romance or religious fervor or european plague.)
- The sex scenes are rather plain and boring. 
- Charlotte Rampling was the most compelling (and secular!) character who really seemed aware of herself and the world she lived in. She plays the game, and makes choices that are fun to watch. I dunno what the hell happened at the end. 
- None of the other characters seem to make choices on their own, really, and it undercuts them terribly. We're always a bit removed from Benedetta, seeing her from the outside, and we shouldn't be. It's meant to be her movie, isn't it?
- The title cards at the end were also dumb, like a last grasp to give the story weight. Oh, she lived at the monastary like a dog from then on, and died an old lady? What difference then does that make compared to what we just saw?

title: "The Third Man"
watched: 2021-11-22
score: 5/5
---
- What I noticed this time: 
- I don't know if the city is a "character" or whatever. 
- The only 2 Americans in the film represent the worst of American attributes: high handed naivete and viscious capitalism. 
- Most of the film takes place at night. The only time we see the sky is during the famous ferris wheel "cuckoo clock" scene. 
- Reed uses the architecture of Vienna as a trap, with the heavy, worn buildings bearing down on inhabitants. Interiors are close up and claustrophoic, even when characters are standing in near empty bars and cafes. 
- All those canted camera angles snuck into dialogue shots. 
- Also! The way Reed uses colorful characters not involved in the story (the little boy with the ball at Lime's apartment building, the old woman chattering non-stop at the girl's place, etc)---they're basically an escape hatch, a way to end scenes with some energy. 
- Harry makes an argument that human life is cheap, and he isn't wrong, but we're still repulsed by what he says. (Even as we're taken in by Welles' charisma.) It's a nice contradiction right after the war. 
- Holly is a blowhard on a high horse at the start, and it takes a bit to knock him down. Then he's willing to sell out his friend for the girl, but doubles back on it once she lays a guilt trip on him. Calloway finally convinces him to do the right thing with a visit to the children's ward at the hospital. But then I got the impression he's motivated by guilt, not by values. Ie, Holly is somehow worse than Harry because Holly's value system is so fungible.
- Cotten is a great actor. I love how open and expressive he is at the start, and how hard his face becomes right before he shoots Harry in the sewer. 
- Never realized Sgt Paine, the politest sergeant in the British Army, is played by Bernard Lee of James Bond fame.

title: "The Power of the Dog"
watched: 2021-11-21
score: 2/5
---
- Incoherent, as if you decided to read the novel but skip every other chapter.
- There's a collection of scenes here and professional actors acted in them and everybody is serious enough so that you know it's Art with a capital-A .. but otherwise ... ??? What was the point of this? The message is muddled.
- Cumberbatch does an excellent job, although some of his choices are dodgy (like the incessant rolling and smoking of cigarettes as if it's a valid character attribute). 
- Wouldn't everybody know Rose and vice versa? Doesn't seem like a lotta people in their neck of the woods. Wouldn't Phil already know that the kid's father committed suicide, and why?
- Bronco Henry loooooooooooool
- Some attributes applied to Phil in an incredibly awkward way. The governor nothing that Phil was Phi Beta Kappa at Yale (to tip the audience the character is smart), the kid finding a secret stash of male nudie mags (to tip that Phil is gay). 
- But for a solid hour of screentime, Phil is a dick just because he's a dick, a bully without reason or sense, and for someone reason his family puts up with it. There's drama there, I guess, but it's so muted and WASPY, it's boring on screen. 
- The ranch hand characters all have names (per IMDb) but they are not defined enough to be meaningful. 
- Phil hates his body, literally stinks on purpose by not bathing often enough, hates what he is, takes it out on everybody else -- but I find this story much less about so called "toxic masculinity" and more about homophobia / repressed homosexuality. It doesn't have very much to say about it, though.  
- The anthrax thing is a big gamble on the kid's part. How was he sure it wouldn't spread?
- Feels like maybe the kid studied to be a doctor so the anthrax subplot would be plausible to the audience, and for no other reason.
- Few of the characters look (too pale) or sound or behave as if they are native to Montanna 1925. Like, that kid with his white canvas shoes on the ranch?? For real? 
- Does Jesse Plemons' character actually do any work, or ...?
- To that, a lot of these ranch people seem to be fucking around in the middle of the day.

title: "House of Flying Daggers (2004)"
watched: 2021-11-21
score: 3.5/5
---
- Slight and linear? Feels oddly superficial, because so much obvious thought went into the visuals and the set-ups (the opening in the brothel, for one, the big sequence in the bamboo forest, for another).
- Gorgeous use of color and a lot of striking shots. 
- Decent melodrama, but also one track and slight (similar, I guess, to "Ju Dou" in that way). 
- The ending isn't quite satisfying and it tries too hard to be bittersweet (Zhang Ziyi stands up and falls down like 3 times after getting stabbed in the chest). Lotsa big reaches for emotion that isn't quite there. The bad guy gets away, the girl dies, and the hero (?) is left in the snow. 
- I like the snowstorm at the end as metaphor but visually it look liked hell (and CGI?). 
- Speaking of which, there was far too much CGI animation. 
- I mean, it's Zhang, so it's beautiful and composed but there was something here that kept me from it. The movie somehow feels false, like it's trying to hard to be this romantic epic wuxia. I dunno. Can't quite put my finger on it. 
- Never quite got invested in the characters beyond their archetype, despite what I thought was a good performance from Zhang Ziyi.
- Once all the obvious and non-obvious double crosses are out in the open, the movie doesn't have many places to go. So..big fight scene in a field! I feel like this was an easy out. The bad guy makes the choice to kill (his) girl and that prevents the more interesting choices Good Guy and Girl would have to make in a final showdown between the government soldiers and the rebels. 
- Interesting, too, that since the Flying Daggers nor the soldiers are characters with any weight, the movie doesn't bother to show us what happened during *their* final showdown. 

---
title: "More discord notes, this time about Shang Chi and No Time to Die" 
---
- I liked it enough. My bar for big budget movies is pretty low---like, was it passably entertaining? i mostly shrugged at No Time To Die, but then I also can't pretend it's not fun to spend time in the Bond universe again
- Shang Chi had a lot of obvious callouts to Hong Kong action movies and wuxia films, so I enjoyed those, like I enjoyed seeing Michelle Yeoh and Yuen Wah at the end.
- It more or less works as a popcorn movie, but it's also Marvel, which means the ending is guaranteed to be a CGI mess, and the story brings up intriguing points (in this case, a difficult father-son relationship) that the movie is never actually prepared to deal with, and thus totally sidesteps during the finale.
- But it's like, I dunno, fine? I didn't feel cheated, and I didn't feel like my time was wasted, and I wasn't actively annoyed by it so ... a mild :yay:
- I mean ... as far as big budget whatevers go, it coulda been a lot worse. It coulda been one of those Netflix movies like Red Notice
- Also, re: No Time to Die --- every time Daniel Craig said something funny or got off a good quip, I thought of Scar's appreciation of him as Bond. Like, the movie is almost unnecessarily grim and Craig and De Armas were the only people in the cast  who seemed to be having fun with it, and remembered, oh yeah, it's a Bond movie
- I really enjoyed those moments. The lame action sequences that played like a twitch stream of a bad FPS...not so much

title: "Cure (1997)"
watched: 2021-11-19
score: ?/5
---
- Fascinated by it but never connected, although it seems well made and deliberate with a lot of strong choices. 
- Good performances by the detective and the killer. Perfect tone.
- Didn't find the explanation (mesmerism? really?) all that satisfying, and the ending, with the doctor committing suicide and the cop murdering the killer, seemed more to give the audience a sense of resolution than anything else really story driven. Especially since the final shots hint the wild behavior is still spreading. 
- Terrible mood so I prolly shouldn't have watch this when I did. 
- Interesting write-up from Labuza here: https://letterboxd.com/labuzamovies/film/cure/

title: "Last Night in Soho"
watched: 2021-11-18
score: 2/5
---
- A hazy sorta movie that literally plays on the surface level. There's good looking stars, production design, and lotsa flashy cinematography but nothing beyond that. There is no detail in the characters or plot, nothing specific to hang on to. Matt Smith's pimp is a pimp and that's all he is. The two women are different shades of naif and never anything more. You don't learn anything about these people by watching the movie. Everything is front loaded and then never explored. Which makes it all the stranger that the movie attempts a mystery in its last 30 minutes or so. 
- Nothing wrong with thin characterizations, or playing from archetype, but if you do that then the plot must have serious rigor. This doesn't. It barely has any plot at all, and no real story. (ie, nothing significant changes from the beginning toward the end, and no characters have an arc.) 
- Neither Thomasin or Anna want anything specific, either. There's nothing pulling them through the movie except runtime. 
- Thomasin's character is an annoying mouse. Taylor-Joy's character is little more than a specter, as is Matt Walsh's pimp. 
- Nothing of interesting until the last 10? 20? minutes when Diana Rigg's landlady goes full talking villain. _Her_ story is kinda sorta interesting (although not exactly fresh), and the explanation comes all at once, in a lump, written and performed as if straight from a tv cop serial. 
- Lotsa visual flash put to no purpose except to include visual flash.
- Very muddled idea in the way McKenzie visits past space: In some shots, she inhabits Taylor-Joy and views events from her point of view. In most others, she's standing outside the action and seeing it as we are (there is no apparent commentary on either POV, and neither does it inform the narrative).
- As if we're getting the real story second hand, and in overwrought flashbacks.
- shockingly bad
- They had about 30 minutes of story here and this fucking thing goes for just under 2 hours. 
- It's tv level writing. 

---
title: "Discord notes"
---
- SHANG CHI :yay: this was fine, although the father's story was more interesting than the son's, and so i think they centered the movie on the wrong character
- NO TIME TO DIE :yay: A big book of James Bond fan fiction, a soap opera for dudes, with a too-sentimental Bond, a non-existent villain, and too many references to the previous films. But it was sorta fun to hang out in that universe again for ... almost 3 hours
- PIG :fresh: I liked this alot while I was watching it, less and less the more I thought about it. It's good as a sorta anti-JOHN WICK and for Cage's performance. The ending was clever. Interesting to me that there's been a string of movies lately (PIG, TITANE, LAMB) that more or less succeeded with audiences while having very simple plots and almost juvenile emotional levels---the message being that trauma can only be assuaged when someone (or something) loves you unconditionally. 

---
title: "Samurai Rebellion"
watched: 2021-11-18
score: 4/5
---
- Another good chanbara melodrama. 
- I think Mifune's presence is welcome but he makes the cast sorta top heavy. Nobody else is at his level, and nobody else has his screentime, or enjoys the same focus. It's his movie but the story is really about the parents and their choices (or it should have been). 

---
title: "Harakiri"
watched: 2021-11-18
score: 5/5
---
- Read several takes which interpret the film as somehow anti-samurai or anti-bushido or whatever, which strikes me as wildly wrong. 
- One hell of a story, perfectly structured between real time and flashbacks. 
- The film is also terrifically macho while being incredibly polite, lol. 
- You only slowly begin to realize just how base and craven this vaunted House really is. 
- I like the idea of these people swapping stories back and forth, as a way to tell us, in the audience, about the bigger story. 
- Hanshiro Tsugumo is the perfect samurai hero, as is Motome Chijiiwa. 
- Also like the way Motome is introduced, and we sneer at him the way the retainers of the House do, and look down on him as weak or shiftless...until later, when Tsugomo reveals exactly why Motome was there. 
- Also like the way Tsugomo's friend and fellow retainer committed suicide to Tsugomo wouldn't have to. 
- If the film critcizes feudal Japan (which I think would be a useless gesture---if it's criticizing anything, it's criticizing fascist Japan---it criticizes soft men of rank, who can be seen running away and hiding at the end of the picture. So that's a class thing in one way, but in another the film takes pains to praise that same class system (eg, through the Real Samurai's efforts to right a wrong done to them).
- Tsugomo and Motome always act properly, even when faced with death. They both die honorably. In speech, thought, and action, they never step outside the bounds of their given roles (well, Motome does a little bit).
- The more interesting part, to me, is whether Motome acted honorably by selling his swords in an attempt to save his family, and by crying out when killing himself with bamboo. That, I think, is up for a good debate. 
- Based on a novel: Yasuhiko Takiguchi (novel "Ibun rônin ki")
- Watched bc of Stalker's dumb commnet, plus this is the third highest rated movie on Letterboxd. Even Duke liked it.

- Yeah, I still don't like this story. In fact, I rather hate it. Too nihilistic. Too dark. And for no good end---either for the characters or the audience. 
- Town is full of shithells, it's physically ugly, why in God's name would anyone want to spend 2 hours here. 
- The "Hero" goes to a lot of trouble and achieves what, exactly? At the end, only 3 people are left alive and what story has been told?
- The addition of a yakuza with a pistol is absent from Leone's "re-interpretation," for obvious reasons, and a nice little wildcard.
- Obviously tho this whole thing makes Leone's attempt look MUCH worse. 
- Interesting too that Leone totally muffed the subplot involving the rescue of the captured wife. IIRC, he puts it more toward the end of his film, causing Blondie to do something uncharacteristically benevolent. Kurusawa uses it as a way to develop the hero's character, and make his actions at the end of the picture have more sense.
- I read once that other Japanese directors accused Kurosawa of pandering to Western audiences, and after seeing this, I understand why. 
- God, the soundtrack is fucking awful and discordant. All those blaring horns (and what that an actual saxophone?). Didn't jive with the material at all.

title: "The Naked Kiss"
watched: 2021-11-18
score: 5/5
---
- Constance Towers hell yes. Helluva performance. 
- Helluva movie. Absolutely shocking. Good melodrama. Extremely sleazy criminal bits. Masterful handling of tone. 
- Body autonomy, yes? The shaved head before credits; the dialogue at the start between Kelly and the Dirty Cop, about the body as "passport;" her job at the hospital helping crippled kids overcome their physical limitations; the dreams of a kid imaginging himself with legs, twirling through the grass; the girl Candy tries to pimp out; the other girl who needs an abortion, etc. 
- The cop is a son of a bitch but the actor doesn't play him that way, as a cheap tough guy, and it adds another layer. 
- Candy's little bon bon club is one of the sleaziest and most depressing spaces in the movies, and it's a huge relief when Kelly visits just to slap the shit out of her. 
- Also liked the way Kelly and Candy are dressed and made up as mirror images of one another --- Candy is what Kelly would have become if Kelly has stayed in the business. 
- Also liked the use of soft dissolves to elide time. (No shitty title cards)
- Kelly's focus on the house key her beau gives her, a path to a respectable life. 
- Also inadventantly an overview of certain careers available to women (prostitute, wife, seamstress, nurse, bar girl, etc.). Fuller's world is a world of limitations (see also: body autonomy and the kid's song.)
- Like how to old pimp and Candy both come back for their shitty revenge at the end. ("Nobody puts dirty money in my mouth.")
- Fuller had some balls putting black and asian kids on screen in an integrated hospital in 1964. Plus there's a shot of a black nurse, too, working alongside white peers. Everybody is equal in this world it's a helluva thing to see. 
- Hits all the entertainment bases: lurid crime	, women's melodrama, and hey, there's even a musical number. 
- The song the kid's sing is sentimental and maudlin but it leans towards the movie's themes. The melody catches the ear. It also a nice offset to the rather grim aspects in the movie. 
- Having the song playing during the molestation scene is some hard bitten genius. 
- Re, molestation: That's some shocker, and the editing there is perfect, going from closeups to long shot of the girl skipping away and back to close ups, to Grant's bullshit rational about how she's "abnormal," too, so they're a good match after all. 
- Loved the ending with her practically walking off into the sunet, alone, like a western hero. She saved the town through lethal violence but now can't live in it. 
- Wouldn't have seen this now save for Stalker's shitty 2 star review of it.

- Bittersweet. I don't think the story ends well for anyone. Left me sad.  
- Absolutely beautiful black and white cinematography and compositions. Director knew how to get the most out of his lighting. 
- Fairly simple story, but I like how it falls like dominoes---one small event (ordering wine for his friend) leads to a chain that erupts in open warfare in the streets. 
- I liked the subplot with the townie brother and sister and the ugliness of their romantic entanglements. 
- Essentially uses the yakuza "war" as a framework to support stories about real humans. 
- WHat's incredible is that there's maybe 2? scenes total where Zatoitchi and the samurai talk, and they speak genially about subjects no consequence, and from that a friendship blossoms and the audience can believe in it. So much to that by the end, when Zatoichi must kill his new friend, it hits hard.
- This is a one off picture (that spawned 26 sequels!), with very small scope, low budget, no stakes, and my God it's just so much better than 99% of the genre shit pumped out by American studios.

- Solid but also Siegel so of course it's violent and dark. 
- Good police procedural at the start, like the reviews on IMDb said, and gets very dark once we follow around the killers/couriers. 
- Finale is a good chase with an explosive ending I didn't expect. The aloof man in the wheelchair falling down on the ice, little girl as hostage, Wallach's body bouncing off the freeway underpass. Jesus! Lotsa explicit violence --- like Siegel shows shit on screen most directors would only hint at. (Or is it the year and the place in the decade? Eg, the rape in "Man of the West")

title: "The Sentinel (1977)"
watched: 2021-11-12
score: 2/5
---
- 70s horror grab bag and dull until the final 10 minutes when the "army of hell" bursts forth. 
- Better "life of a NY model" stuff in "Eyes of Laura Mars," which isn't a great movie either but at least it can hold interest. This one is just boring. There's no there there. No characters and no scenarios to get invested in. Just this chick and her sleazy lawyer boyfriend.
- The horror elements are good and strong but they're too few and far between. 45 minutes into the picture before you see anything freaky or scary. 
- Central problems: The heroine is too passive. She doesn't make active choices about anything, except the one not to live with her boyfriend. Otherwise, it's Sarandon's show. His character pushes the plot forward and he's the one who gets to the bottom of the mystery. 
- The big explanation of what The Sentinel is (a guardian at the doorway to hell) is very cool but is also waaaay convoluted. The church is somehow involved, of course, in something throughout the movie but we don't know exactly what until the last 10 minutes. 
- The structure is all over the place. The lead chick model is practically abandoned about half way through the movie, when she becomes seriously ill. 
- Eli Wallach's cop and the subplot involving the lawyer's murdered wife is introduced and then thrown away. 
- Likewise the suicide angle and all the previous "sentinels" who mysteriously disappeared so they could become The Sentinel. 
- The old time murderers as ghost neighbors is another cool idea that's crudely handled, to the degree all sense of terror or wonder at it is muffled. 
- Weirdly packed cast with old Hollywood greats (Ava Gardner as a real estate agent???) mixing with new fresh faces (Christopher Walken, Beverly DiAngelo, Jerry Orbach, Jeff Goldblum, etc).

![Prom Night poster art, 1980]({{ site.img }}prom-night-1980.jpg){: width="222" height="337" .top .right .pull .tilt .border }

It has a cool poster, so that's something, right? But the actual experience is poor. "Prom Night" borrows heavily from better movies, and doesn't offer anything new in the borrowing. The script takes concepts from "Black Christmas," "Carrie," and "Halloween," and drops them nearly unchanged into a slightly different suburban nowhere. So we get this ersatz version of things, paler and dumber than in the original sources---a lunatic escaped from an asylum, breathy telephone calls from the killer, mean girls conspiring to ruin the prom queen's big night. The rest is an unending series of whys. Why is Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie? Why does Leslie Nielsen's character disappear? Why include a sweet, youthful romance, unconnected to the rest of the story? Why is the villain dressed like a stock photo burglar? Why is the school so lame, and every kid a square? Why why why? Watching "Prom Night" turned my face into a [reaction meme](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Confused+Reporter+Jonathan+Swan&iax=images&ia=images).

- I liked this a little less than my previous views (March's alcoholism is addressed but not resolved) and this time Teresa Wright's performance really stood out, and Harold Russell seems like the only element of the movie that's not a put-on, that's real and genuine and human. 
- Also one of the very best moments occurs near the beginning, when Loy and March see each other for the first time.

- The big book of James Bond fan fiction, with Bond here being waaaaay more sentimental and moody than he ever was in Fleming's books. It's a comic book world now so nothing here has weight, and even the surprising plot points don't have permanence. Bond and M bicker like 2 siblings. The girls are okay but also inconsequential. Never reaches any sort of height with its action sequences. I kept waiting for the traditional theme to really kick in but it never does. I watched with a shrug.

watched: 2021-11-07

- Despite the cheese, the bad special effects, the terrible creature make-up, the lame costumes, it _still_ has an oppressive, chilling, creepy effect.
- Lee's best perf? He certainly has more to do here than in his other famous roles.
- I liked how this throws you right into the middle of things, with no warning and no explanation, and the story keeps turning, never pausing for breath. Reminds me of a Sax Rohmer style adventure, or Dr Strange before Dr Strange. I wish they had more of these starring Lee.
- Very good villain in Charles Gray, the Bond dude.
- When did this take place? The characters wear contemporary clothes, but everyone drives a vintage roadster and there are no telephones, afaik?
- Very good review on IMDb: https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0102066/
- I agree that the ending works well, and is appropriately wild and unpredictable, but let down by cheap F/X
- Again, strange to consider this among the wider film world --- movie was released the same year as "Rosemary's Baby"

title: "Criss Cross"

- Mish-mash! Mish-mash!
- The kinda movie that suffers with 20/20 hindsight, having seen Lancaster, De Carlo, and Duyyea in much better stuff.
- Would have been more interesting if Duryea and Lancaster had switched roles.
- Lancaster can't hide his athleticism and the confidence that goes with it, although it's interesting to see him in a role where he hasn't developed the usual  tics or delivery. Watching him in this, it's as if he doesn't yet know how to put weight or personality into the performance.
- Couldn't believe Lancaster as the sucker and didn't believe De Carlo as the woman from around the way who everybody gets in a twist over.
- De Carlo had more allure at 40 or 50 than 25 or 30.
- Good hook at the start, with the criminals faking out the local cop, and the intro to robbery
- The extended flashback is pretty shit tho. There wasn't enough desperation and longing between Lancaster and De Carlo relationship to make their relationship  believable.
- The movie has a big scene with Napier explaining how they'll steal the money, and seems to go to a great deal of detail (with the oil truck block the bridge, etc) but when the times comes, we don't see hardly any of it! Big wtf from me.
- The ending has a nice hard edge, but it's also incredibly silly, with the hospital nurse prattling on, and the guy showing up out of nowhere to kidnap Lancaster, but being bribable, too.
- Still can't figure out how De Carlo got the bag full of money? The robbery was a bust. Unless she stole it, somehow, from Duryea? I dunno.
- The robbery scene was cinematic? I guess? All those smoke cannisters and foggy effects. Looked nice but didn't play well. Hard to make another armored car heist look interesting, even in the mid 40s.

- Might be the best action movie I've seen (yes, that includes "Die Hard," you simps).
- Extremely efficient. Wastes no time establishing the interpersonal conflicts & they add spice & don't overbear.
- Liked Gable's captain as a guy obsessed with evening the score, while not being Caine crazy or a dickhead.
- Incredible action sequence going into the ending, with the depth charges, injuries, and damage to the ship, plus Lancaster's decision to take over.
- Very good twists with Gable falling ill & the surprise! Japanese submarine at the end.
- Goddamn, this was a great movie. Whole thing on board ship, cramped quarters, tight shots. Editing more important than camera movement. Incredible.

- There's nothing in the photograph I can tell you about you can't already see for yourself. A young Debbie Harry enjoying a small moment in time. I don't know anything about anything, but if you're making a movie about kids and the 70s and music and calling it "Licorice Pizza" and you're not matching the energy and allure of Debbie in these well known photos by Chris Klein, what are you even doing? It's a bad judgement, I know. Too quick. Alls I've seen is the trailer. I haven't seen the movie and no one has, so how can I say with confidence? You're right. I can't. But still. I look at the photo and think...what are you even doing?

title: "Curse of the Werewolf"
watched: 2021-11-04
score: 4/5
---
- Another good looking Hammer production.
- And another that surprises with its structure, and the way it modifies existing mythologies.
- Lythancopy is an inherited trait, which I think is a major change to the whole werewolf thing. It's not the result of an assault, or an attack, and no one can blame the kid for being born (especially as a rape baby).
- Basically a movie in 3 parts, very ambitious as it covers half a lifetime or so.
- First part is the backstory to our wolf. Er, how his mom met his dad. A cruel country, which figuratively ("he can be your pet!" the marquis tells his new bride) and literally (the beggar goes feral once he's forgotten in jail).
- Second part is the young kid, the adopted and accepting and permissive parents, who aren't married, and the village priest who knows too much.
- Third part is our wolf's attempt to make a life for himself and failing. The love triangle with the vinyard owner's daughter and a local lord, etc.
- Great makeup effects but unfortunately we don't see them until the final 10 minutes of the movie.
- I probably would have enjoyed this more if I went at it from the correct angle---but I wanted the monster earlier, and more monster action.
- Lotsa opportunities for good melodrama (the local watchman, his barkeep wife, those silver bullets; the adopted parents, their platonic relationship as master and servant, not husband and wife; the village priest's guilty knowledge, the limits of his culpability for the murders tha follow; the father having to put his own adopted son down at the end.)
- Lotsa layers and a lot of characters to juggle in a movie is ~90 minutes.

watched: 2021-11-03

- As if Vogue Italia decided to make a proto-F13. A beautiful bore. It's a great looking film with a superthin plot and no characters. Anytime we follow anyone, they die in the next 10 minutes. Moderately more interesting in the final 30 minutes as the killer(s) are revealed and at least then the movie has _some_ kinda perspective. But then the killers aren't all that interesting, either, and the reason they killed so many is another bore.
- But again the lighting and camera are next level.
- One virtuoso sequence of the girl in the antique shop/warehouse, as she tries to evade the killer.
- Likewise early and the focus on the handbag holding the diary, as the girls hit the runway for the fashion show.

- As if the screenwriter wanted to imitate Runyon, but then drank too much coffee and couldn't stop typing.
- the premise is good but the macguffin is a bore. commies? microfiche? for real? but I like the idea of this two bit guy lifting something he shouldn't have.
- the romance is a sham. she falls for him in less than a day?
- Thelma Ritter, of course. She should have won.
- one of those new york movies where you don't see new york. there might be 1 or 2 street shots in the whole thing 	half the movie centers around the protagonist's shack on the waterfront, which is an unbelievable location.
- Good performances all around, which makes it worth it.

title: "Niagara"
watched: 2021-11-01
score: 3/5
---
- Hathaway attempts Hitchcock. All the seeds are here. Nothing sprouts. Marilyn Monroe plays a real villain, a cruel, dupiclitous woman out to murder her husband. Joseph Cotten tiptoes around Niagara Falls as the cuckolded spouse. Jean Peters, straight off "Pickup on South Street," is a conventional bride on her honeymoon, finding herself caught in the middle. You'd think you couldn't lose with that setup, but you can.
- Hathway, Zanuck, and TKTK whiffed a surefire, because they split the narrative focus. The movie jumps from character to character, and changes tone often enough, that any potentional tension is lost. We get a little of the story from Monroe, then a little from Cotten, then a little from Peters, and back again. There's no single perspective to get behind. No real build-up. No throughline. It ends with an expected big action climax, one a little too obvious given the film's setting.
- It's a shame, and I could stop there, but as muddled as it is, and as little as I enjoyed it, "Niagara" contains one or two outstanding moments worth a mention.
- Hitchcock by Hathaway.
- Good set up and I like the idea of Monroe playing this duplicitous bitch.
- The movie has no focus. It splits time between 4 different characters but there's no throughline there, and no tension.
- There's one moment between Monroe and Cotten that is natural and effortless and amazing, like 2 people being in a moment and real.
- One good shot after Cotten murders Monroe in the clock tower.
- According to Wikipedia, chunks of the ending are missing.

title: "Blind Beast"
watched: 2021-11-01
score: 4/5

- Super fucking weird and not what I expected.
- I thought this would be a pink film, a proto titty flick, basic exploitation 50 years past. But it's actually an art film-cum-body-horror.
- Heavy voice over at the beginning and end, which isn't exactly filmic but adds to it. Help a lot. The impression and mood.
- The "artist of touch" and a new art form.
- A movie about desire and consumption, about wanting to consume and be consumed. People as fetish objects, but also wanting to be an object. To experience any kind of intensity, the day-to-day so muted as it is.
- Also the photographer/photographs at the start: another form of capture and ownership.
- First part, yeah thought plain "woman in danger" thing but the movie pulls its first surprise: She's a lot smarter than her captor and wastes no time manipulating him.
- Second part, delicious little psychological thriller. With the girl and her odd little smile as she manipulates the sculptor while daring the mom with her eyes.
- Third part, impressionistic. The tonal and narrative change is startling, and I initially rebelled against it, but then XX takes the film to much darker, weirder places than I imagined. (Those lines about the jellyfish in the deep, etc)
- Much less explicit than contemporary movies but oh so much more effective.
- It's rare for a movie to surprise me this much, and still leave behind a lasting thought.

title: "Yellow Sky"
watched: 2021-11-01
score: 4/5

- Gregory Peck wears the black hat. A group of bank robbers cross the desert and discover an old man and a young girl living in a ghost town. There's gold in the hills and Apaches nearby. The pair sit on an abandoned fortune and the robbers want a cut. Lotsa noir shades, but not as try-hard as some others (it thankfully lacks the glib dialogue, for one). "Yellow Sky" is littered with grimy characters who wouldn't be out of place in one of Mann's westerns, and they're played by good actors. Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark, Harry Morgan. Anne Baxter stands out as a tomboy with a six gun on her hip who doesn't melt for anyone. Wellman shot on location in Death Valley, and there's some strong compositions among the high desert crags, with sound to match, as voices and gunfire reverberate off the rocks with a hollow echo. This was the late '40s, around the time of Ford's Calvary trilogy and Hawk's "Red River," but the movie looks cruder and cleaner, and plays nastier, as if it might have been made 10 or 20 years later.

- One one level an idiosyncratic neo-noir. Would make a good double bill with "Kid Detective." Maybe.
- Not at all what I expected. Much better.
- Heard this was a revenge (?!) tale, but it's not.
- Themes are apparent (grief, art, authenticity), but Cage's reduced performance makes it work. He delivers a great monologue ("We get so few things to care about") at that restaurant Eurydice (that, too, a little on the nose).
- Likewise the dialogue, which is plainspoken. ("Then why did we do all this?" "Because I love her.")
- Like the editing here, which is assured and crisp. Cuts out a lot of bullshit. Knows the strength of it.
- Director lets scenes play without interference, keeping the camera on faces when he needs to.
- Also liked Adam Arkin's reserve. The dinner scene where he eats the meal and comes to tears, remembering.
- I liked the little turn of him not being able to listen to the cassette tape at the beginning, then listening to it at the end. And looking upwards in the final shot.

- Fantasy and metaphor and little else.
- God, I hated this. Big step down from "Raw," which at least had an understandable human element to match its gross out body horror. And more importantly, in her first feature, the body horror made sense and was directly tied to the narrative.
- Every time a character is alone in a room, they take off their clothes and do something weird.
- I think this is only "good" by comparison, because other major releases don't try nearly as hard and don't have this level of arbitrary imagination.
- Ducarneau is always so in control, that even when the film makes no sense it feels good going there.
- Too many hurdles to hop over. She willfully bursts through suspension of disbelief like a dare, to tell a story that's too simple and rather boring. Lotsa flourish to hide little effect.
- If the film had good writing --- rather than bursts of imagination --- the Faux Dad would never have had to say "I love you and you're my son no matter who you are" directly in dialogue. We'd know it, and the heroine would too, without him saying it.
- Like an angry chick version of Neil Gaiman. Lotsa great visuals and visual ideas, very little rigor with regards to  storytelling (which I think is the harder part).
- For a movie with so much crazy, it has zero nuance.
- From MC discord: "Strongly disagree about the supposed message. I mean, aside from it being point blank in your face and completely lacking in nuance --- it's sorta a greeting card version of Martin Guerre, and totally incurious about its own character's motivations"
- Jesus, Ducournau really is full of shit: [Under Her Skin Julia Ducournau lets us in on the years of fury, angst, and comedy that fueled the Palme d’Or–winning, genre-smashing Titane.](https://www.vulture.com/2021/10/julia-ducournau-on-writing-titane-2021s-boldest-film.html) and [Their Film Is One of the Weirdest Prizewinners of the Year.

- Can't go wrong with Delmer Daves.
- I didn't fully buy Lemmon's constant, self-righteous fury (Montgomery Clift was better at it in "Red River"). It's so one note, and Lemmon's delivery has no spin.
- Individually some very good scenes, especially the bull ring game in Mexico.
- Every time I forget how good Glenn Ford was, I see one of his movies and remember. The guy could play anything.
- I liked the the message here, about working a job and working with men, and knowing what matters and what doesn't, and some of the nuance around it. Lemmon's character has a nice arc.
- A good and honest explosion of some cowboy and trail myths.
- Pretty bold of Daves to tread on "Red River's" ground only 10 years after the fact.
- Liked how Lemmon as the greenhorn is the only guy to acknowledge some Natives in town, at the start of the trail, but very much later he has no problem shooting them down.

- One one level, strangely involving. On another, indie movie bullshit. There's an entire subplot involving a bum brother that could have been cut. But that would make the movie ~80 minutes at most, maybe an hour.
- Generates unease and tension from small events, like the disappearance of the dog, or the tractor klunking out. Smartly leaves some threads hanging for a looong time.
- Like about how nobody talks about where Ada came from, or how. Really muted the idea of the father in my mind until the end.
- Treats the audience a little stupid sometimes. We didn't need the graveside scene to understand why the couple take to Ada the way they do. (The crib on hand was enough).
- Still, always leaning forward in my seat, wanting and waiting to see what came next.
- I have no idea what this movie was attempting to say, though, if anything, with its bookended murders.
- I Wonder if the big ram dude at the end loved that sheep. He must've, right? He killed for her.
- One thing I did like: How the odd, sudden ending completely breaks the movie's spell.
- If this had been 70 minutes, it would have been brilliant.
- Must be intentional, yah? And meaningful. The way violence bookends the movie.
- Left me feeling melancholy. They were happy for a time, and perfect, and then it ended forever.

- Some very good animated Japanese sci-fi. Not on the level of "Akira" or "Ghost in the Shell," but close.
- An anthology, but I didn't realize that going in.
- All 3 stories take a rote premise and do something interesting with them
- "Magnetic Rose" is appropriately creepy and weird, but goddamn if I remember the ending or the why of it, ie why a derelic, haunted spaceship would send out a distress signal. Pretty effective images. Some interesting ideas, although the writers are more interested in one character (the guy with the family) than the others.
- "Stink Bomb" is too long. We get the set up and the joke and it just keeps going. I liked that it was simulataneously a criticism and a praise of salaryman, though. The Mr Magoo guy is extremely ingenious in getting where he needs to go (and more often than not succeed by luck, like Magoo) but he's also too fucking dumb to know he's literally toxic, and follows his boss' instructions to the letter, regardless of consequence.
- Mixed on "Canon Fodder." Terrific animation style. So-so story --- a super militarized future Japan with an obvious critcism baked in. It's a child's idea of war, and the film literally enters a child's crayong drawing toward the end, which is sorta perfect but also sorta tiring in a glib "we've always been at war with eastasia" way.

- Décolletage: The Movie
- Another great looking Hammer, with all the expected flourish. Sets and costumes are terrific. It's a great looking movie.
- Intruiging at the start as most of the charaters are unlikeable. Cushing as fantatic vs the evil and hedonistic count. The woodsman guy feels almost an afterthought, and the movie would have been better without him as he's a duplicate hero, the stand in actiong guy.
- Liked the twins enough, even though their characters are unexplored. The evil one going out every night, because she doesn't want to feed on her sister.
- The ending is a little too gratuitous, and the boobage feels like Hammer reaching (har har) too hard, like they are just out and out pandering to the audience.
- Big action climax (suddenly the entire village turns out) and it's fine although there's an unforunate level of camp in it.
- I did like how Cushing played his fanatic a little softer at the end. His facial expressions vs line readings add emotion to rather hard-edged dialogue, the two contradicting each other and demonstrating his split loyalty.
- As with "Brides of Dracula," the villain is a huge dork and not intimadating or scary at all.

- Mal says, "Its saying people need to fuck" and sure. But why structure the story in such a convoluted way? The ending feels like it should be a big reveal but it isn't.

title: "Evil Dead Trap"
watched: 2021-10-26
score: 2/5

- Plays as a fairly typical slasher for the first hour, but with a great deal of visual flair (and a very boring killer). There's a lot of weird angles and interesting inserts -- VHS tape, shots of CRTs, degraded b&w photography, etc.
- The kills are inventive, but designed more for appearance than reality.
- The last 40 minutes is pure sloth. It takes too long to get going, there's too much useless dialogue. The brother reveal is obvious from the start and played off too casually. The monster is fucked up and sorta interesting but also non-sensical. So I dunno.
- If it had been gonzo from the start, I woulda dug it.
- Enjoyed the synth soundtrack, repetitive and energetic, sorta sub-Tangerine Dream.

- Proto-de Palma. Everything he does here, he did better in later films. His weaknesses as a storyteller are more evident, though, despite all the cinematog flash.
- I would have enjoyed this more if the script wasn't so half-assed. DePalma riffs on Hitchcock, Fuller, somebody else? while setting up an interesting central mystery --- and then blows it off.
- The ending is like an attempt at later Lynch, but with no skill for it. The black and white dream sequence is ugh.

- Certainly beautiful but boring as hell. Argento has maybe 40? or 50? minutes of material here? The pacing kills the suspense. OTOH, the opening sequence is one for the ages and absolutely terrific. I'd write more but what is there to write about? Nothing, save the pretty shots and a good score.
- Also positive it doesn't play fair with the audience as the girl isn't shown with the knife at the beginning. Still, tag team killers (Scream?) is a nice touch. Too bad it takes ages and ages to get there.

title: "The Fate of Lee Khan"

score: 5/5

- Incredible, except for the ending, which is also very wuxia. By that I mean, they get to a certain point in the story and just say, fuck it, let'swrap this up. And then everybody fights. Big fight. Epic fight. Memorable fight. But still.
- I liked very much how this was single location, and almost a single room, but never felt claustrophobic. French scenes within French scenes.
- Also the transition and build up of the first hour, all the different characters and types at the inn, a very gentle introduction to the world, and could have almost been a completely different movie, and the second, after Lee Khan appears and takes over.
- Tien Feng is quite initimates as Khan, while also retaining the ability to look terribly bored with his lessers.
- The chick playing the princess. Cold as ice.
- Got a little lost in the final act with all the intrigues piled on intrigues.
- I liked when characters would lean in and whisper to one another and there would be no dialogue on the soundtrack. Their plans are so secret not even the audience is allowed to overhear it.

title: "Quatermass and the Pit (1958, tv serial)"
watched: 2021-10-20
score: 5/5

- So effectively weird and creepy that I can't believe they broadcast this on television, especially with that ending and some of those shots --- London ruined, on fire, mass craze.
- TV show that's shot, a lot of the time, as if it were a theatrical release
- You can see smatterings of Nigel Kneale (the writer's) style in the filmed version of Quatermass Xperiment, bursts here and there, and it's in full flourish in the serial.
- Throws around a lot of quirky scifi ideas, without resorting to bullshit action sequences or grimdark nonsense (nobody runs, nobody pulls a gun!)
- Very nice slow and even build to a wild ending. The discovery of the bones, then the discovery of the bomb-like object, then the discovery of the full "missle," then the insects and the noise and the craziness.
- Also really dug how the wove in myth, legend, and religion into a sci-fi plot. The creatures are the basis of demons and devils! The models for gargoyles!
- I like Andre Morrell's interpretation of the character. Much warmer than so-and-so in the filmed version of "Xperiment," although the character still doesn't hesistate to do grossly unethical things (like experiement on civilians in a pinch, as he does with the drill guy and the scientist's assistant in episode 5 or so).
- I really like how Nigel Kneal handles exposition. Instead of having main characters stand around trading lines of technobabble, he introduces one off characters to do the heavy lifting (eg: Rosie in Xperiment; the old woman and her husband here, living close to the pit; the people in the pub trying to watch a tv broadcast from the pit).
- Plus, he always has a few moments for groundwork or humanity (eg: that crazy contraption to capture the "mind's eye," mentioned early in episode 1 or 2 but not used until the end; the old woman reading tea leaves "you ARE a skeptic!"; the priest in late episodes; the policeman in Xperiment commenting about his own shaving habits, lunch with his wife, etc).
- Uses the Holmes/Spock trope of having a super intelligent character (Qmass in this case) pull an absolutely crazy theory out of thin air and sell it (that we're all really Martians in this case). But the audiences believes because we want to believe and those types of characters are always credible.
- Also Qmass is the grandfather to Kolchak and Mulder.
- A similar model here to what streaming corps are attempting now --- genre based limited serial, with tons of action and plot, but so much more successfull.
- Again really doesn't look like a tv show on a limited budget. Curious how much they spent and how that spend compared to other shows. Contemporary low budget wannabes working now could learn a thing or two.

title: "Odd Thomas"
watched: 2021-10-20
score: 2/5
---
- Essenially a superhero fantasy with very light horror elements. Sommers direction and editing intrude on the story constantly, and the movie has a choppy feel. The story is written at a TV sitcom level, the central romance adolescent and unbelievable. It also relies on CGI for even basic movement, running, jumping, fights. An epilogue is grossly sentimental and, like everything else, overdone. This is a shame because there's some charm to premise, and Yelstin is a good actor capable of a lot more. The final shot sets up possible sequels, which Sommers fortunately never made. Based on the novel by Dean Koonz, but if you'd ask me afterwards, I'd have guessed it was adapted from some rando YA.

title: "Urban Legends: Final Cut"
watched: 2021-10-20
score: 2/5

- There's an aspect that could be read as sly commentary: the lone female director is constantly derided and threatened by her male peers, despite her clear intentions and professional approach, which made me think, hey, maybe they're trying to say something real? About working as a woman in the film industry?
- But then ... it's also a movie where somebody dies, and that somebody appears in the very next scene, curiously alive, explaining they're the twin nobody knew about, and now they must find their sibling's killer.
- So yeah.
- The dialogue is campy. There's multiple visual gags. The tone is light. But the violence is staged as legit horror (even if it's full of expected tropes and beats). I enjoyed what there was to enjoy. The cast is young and good looking. Some of it's funny. Part of me wished the producers had more fully committed one way or the other, though.

title: "Village of the Damned (1960)
watched: 2021-10-19
score: 3/5

- I wish it were possible to go in cold, but the movie's been referenced and ripped off for so long that's impossible. Even the VHS box art is a bit of a spoiler.
- "Brood parasites" as sci-fi reminds me of that James Tiptree story "Screwfly Solution"
- Takes awhile to establish the creepy kids, which is fine, except you know where it's going.
- The lead creepy kid is quite good (and quit acting once he reached adulthood! Fucker is still alive!)
- The scene with the shotgun murder is very tense and very good.
- Did like the awkward wigs/haircuts that seemed to give the children misshapen heads. Added to the creepiness.
- Another British sci-fi that somehow lacks humanity or empathy. The kids are a plot problem and nothing more. The only conceivable solution is violence (and suicide?!).
- A little disappointed in the ending. (Besides, if you wanted to blow the kids up, couldn't the army have shelled their house from a distance?)
- An iconic horror film that has little more to offer than an icon.

- Five stars for Rosie, who wasn't seeing "gin goblins" this time.
- Another 5 stars for the hirsute policeman and his wife.
- And cheers to actor playing the lone surviving astronaut, creating a whole character without relying on dialogue.
- Has a very slow start for a movie that's only 75 minutes long. I keep wanting to push it and somehow make the movie get to the point.
- The reveal of the creature was good, maybe great.
- Liked the scene at the zoo, in the aftermath of the creature's feeding, the men standing around examining alien remains, and you can hear the sound of a jet on the soundtrack.
- There was potential for a lot of schlocky 50s sci-fi here, but the more human moments make it shine, as do the top tier makeup and creature effects. The makeup was particularly shocking in some scenes, really horrific.
- The live BBC show at Westminster Abbey, creating a nice little meta effect.
- Quatermass is a boor. The other characters are more interesting.
- Presentation is weird --- nobody cares about the astronaut or his wife, and Q only seeks to understand the mystery, the science. Once the astronaut escapes and begins transforming, nobody refers to him as a man. His wife, gone "bonkers" at seeing his transformation, disappears from the picture.

## Dune
- The best sci-fi tv show of the year. Suitably epic, almost ponderously so. Every other scene has grand music against long shots. Dialogue is at a 3rd grade level. Interactions are soapy, like a long and expensive episode of Game of Thrones, but in space. Serious mismatch in the ability level of the cast (Momoa opposite Isaac, for example). Scenes are so skint, only hitting the plot highlights, that the movie feels like the Cliffs Notes version of the novel. I remain unconvinced Herbert's work can actually be adapted into a visual medium.

## Dracula A.D. 1972
### Helsie the Vampire Hunter, Part 2
- Another good start with a muddled execution. I like the idea of inter-generational vampire hunters, but the movie has 2 or 3 distinct character groups and none are given enough attention. The result is well paced but somehow feels rushed at the same time, and the ending is cheesy without being entertaining. Overall, the movie turns Hammer, Cushing, and Lee into relics and squares, out of touch with then-current trends. (Case in point: this movie was released the same year as Craven's "Last House on the Left.")
- Some good ideas but the pacing is wonky for a 90 minute movie. They burn 10 minutes on 2 musical numbers (groovy baby) at the start, in a sequence unconnected to anything else in the movie.
- Highlight is the Black Mass scene, which is suitably weird (the recitation of demon names) and cheesy (the music, the kids acting stoned) and gross (pouring a goblet of blood over one of your friends).
- There's a very obvious subtext here that the younger generation is good for nothing, and loyal to nothing, not even each other. (Like, they bolt and leave Laura alone in the church after the Black Mass, and they hang out all the time but nobody knows where anybody else lives?)
- Takes nearly 40 minutes for Drac to appear, and afterwards he does nothing. Never even leaves the deconsecrated church where he was first summoned.
- I like the idea of multi-generational vampire hunters, but Jessica, the granddaughter, is treated as a plot object, and mostly sidelined.
- The scenes between the cops and Van Helsing are good, but also packed with exposition about vampires which (a) the audience already knows and (b) comes pretty late in the film.
- Several teen characters disappear after the Black Mass scene (specifically, 2 of the boys).
- Naturally the cops let Van Helsing do whatever he wants and risk his life at the end. They, too, sorta disappear from the movie after the first murder.
- Would have been more interesting if it had full committed to one character group or the other. Pick Van Helsing and the cops or Alucard and the kids. But they split the runtime between them, and the film barely hangs on.
- Ending fight between Van Helsing and Drac is pretty cheesy and anticlimatic. Makes Hammer look out of touch given other releases around that era.

## Brides of Dracula
- Very strong start, weakend by a lame villain and his henchwomen.

## The Gorgon
- Good premise, surprisingly mediocre execution from Fisher. Muddled, wandering script with no center. The romantic lead is a lump. Cushing and Lee are supporting players, and have no scenes together until the very end. The villain is the most passive killer in the movies; she literally needs to do nothing to her victims except stand in place. The subtext around a woman turning people to stone every 28 days is certainly ... something.

## Hound of the Baskervilles
- Cushing is a good Holmes, but I may have enjoyed André Morell as Watson a touch more. Nice change of pace to see Lee play an actual human being and not a mythological monster (he has dialogue in this one!).

## Last Train from Gun Hill
- Obvious similarities to "3:10 to Yuma" aside, good performances and a great ending.

## Peeping Tom
- Highest of trash art and extremely disturbing. I love Powell & Pressburger's work, and this is in league with the rest, but I almost wish I hadn't seen it.

## Curse of Frankenstein
- Beautiful and grotesque. As much spiritual horror as body horror.

## Halloween Kills
- Just another bad Halloween sequel, and nearly incoherent, with The Shape running around killing randos, while other randos gather to stop him. The 1978 original and 2018 reboot are heavily referenced in every other scene, making the movie feel self indulgent and fan-servicey. Might have worked as pure splatterpunk, but the violence isn't that interesting either.

## There's Someone Inside the House
- Based on a YA novel and it shows. The script reads as if it were worked over by one too many sensitivity readers. The result is a movie with no personality, a horror movie strives to challenge no one. "Someone" is a small town teen melodrama, with generic slasher elements borrowed from sub-"Scream" 90s horror
