My name is Tom Bomba. I have no bylines or awards to show you. I am neither journalist nor critic, and I've never been on staff. I am another rando on the internet, starting from nowhere, and wanting to speak.

<i>{{ site.title }}</i> is about the west, about American mythology through media. The rough borders of my interest stretch from the Mississippi to the Pacific, up through the Yukon, down to Panama, and maybe a little further.

So, yes, this is another site about movies and books, but also sometimes art and design, when and where I can manage, and everything viewed through an intentionally limited, geographic lens.

I hope you enjoy it.
