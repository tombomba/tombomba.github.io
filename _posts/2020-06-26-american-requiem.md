["Love is the message, and the message is Death"](https://www.moca.org/program/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death) is a collection of found images, Getty archives, news broadcasts, dashcam reels, and video clips, edited and arranged by Arthur Jafa, set to Kanye's ["Ultalight Beam,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oHdAA3AqnE) and made into a work of extraordinary art.

Jafa is a cinematographer and artist who has worked with Spike Lee, Julie Dash, and Jay-Z. "Love is the message" was acquired by the Hirshhorn Museum along with the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2018. The film is playing in [virtual screenings](https://hirshhorn.si.edu/news/press-release/love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death-streamed-june-26-28/) at 13 museums this weekend.

"Love is the message, and the message is Death" is a history lesson in seven minutes and thirty seconds. The film is not easy to watch. It reflects private joy and public brutality, from the famous to the more obscure, and most of the footage is all too recent.

One moment will stick with me: A close-up of a young woman riding silently in a car and looking straight at the camera. As she looks out, her expression doesn't change but her gaze travels for a mile and a year, and keeps going, her face the face of someone who has seen too much in too short a time. She doesn't have to say for you to know.
