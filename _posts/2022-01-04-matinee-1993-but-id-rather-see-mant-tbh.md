I mean. It's okay. There's nothing really out and out _wrong_ but the story and the characters are a trifle.

Dante's paen to old schlock horror, William Castle, and the atomic era by way of the Cuban Missile crisis. I think this would land better for people who actually remember these things first hand, over people who only read about them in books, or saw them on late night t.v.

Goodman is good as expect, but he doesn't have enough to do and it's very hard to drive a narrative based on someone's unabashed love of an art form.

There's a couple of romance subplots involving some kids, but none of them are particularly interesting, and the kid actors are fine without being enganging.

It's lack of plot (or really: purpose) forces the movie into 3rd act shenanigans. A roughneck robs the box office, some kids get trapped in a bomb shelter, the theater's balcony collapses after the patrons run out, etc. etc.

Gene Siskel asked whether this movie was more fun than the movies it celebrates and I must say no. (Although the "mant" creature is actually well done!)
