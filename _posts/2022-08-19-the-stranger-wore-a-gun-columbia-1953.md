Almost a proto-"Fistful of Dollars," as Randolph Scott plays bandit groups off against one another in a small Arizona town just after the Civil War. Director Andr√© de Toth delivers his usual stylistic flair on an obviously low budget, staging action sequences with a good, dangerous energy. "Stranger" doesn't take advantage of its premise, though, and the script is muddled. A morally dark opening sequence, where Scott helps Southern outlaws sack Lawrence, Kansas, is awkwardly connected to the rest of the film. Most of the characters are never much more than broad archetypes, lashed to the plot, and their dialogue is perfunctory. Small events and whole conversations are referenced but not depicted, and it's as if a reel went missing somewhere. Claire Trevor stands out as a love interest for Scott, breathing full life into a thankless supporting part. Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin round out the cast, both doing what they do, but doing better work elsewhere in better movies.
