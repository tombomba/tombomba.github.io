title: "James Gray, the current slate, and the persistent myth of cinema"
description: "I dunno. He's not wrong, but he's still wrong."

In a [short video](https://deadline.com/video/armageddon-time-james-gray-cannes-film-festival-box-office-streaming/), director James Gray covers box office and streaming content, film festivals and award shows, and loosely describes why, to paraphrase, "studios should be able to lose money on art specialty divisions." Gray just debuted his latest at a major international film festival. I am writing this in a small apartment while still in my pajamas. I'm in no position to tell him what's what. He's smart and articulate here, and makes good conventional sense. And yet...he's only ["correct, as always"](https://twitter.com/SeanFennessey/status/1528526055916466176) under the narrowest of terms and the strictest of definitions. I find the viewpoint weirdly insular, another reflection of a twitchy and defensive film culture.

Gray argues that major studios alienated part of their audience when they gave the theatrical space over to broad based genre flicks. Your boy wizards and impossible missions shut out everything else, and now there is nothing else. With such a rigid selection, people turned away and eventually lost "the habit of going to the movies." He suggests smaller films are an investment in the theatrical future, and studios should be willing to lose money on them. Nothing wrong with superheroes. They're fine. But non-commercial work with potential might pay dividends. Spend a little now, grow that general audience, get back more later. The model we have today, with its narrow appeal and shrinking attendance, makes movies less culturally relevant, and creates its own trouble, a sorta cinematic death spiral. Gray cites Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather" and Ang Lee's "The Ice Storm" to bolster portions of his argument.

He begins by saying, "Theatrical is essential." Right there I could stop and write an entirely separate rebuttal, because...essential to whom, exactly? Can't be the vaguely theater-going public of our collective imagination. Their failure to show up is the whole problem, right? The underlying idea at play---that the theatrical experience is core to the medium---is often expressed by those same types who pontificate about cinema as their religion, about movie theaters as their church. Given the grim reality of premium tickets, block programming, noisy patrons, expensive concessions, cell phones, universal DCP, and your typical dead mall megaplex, you must be a true believer to see the movie theater as "essential."

Phew. _Cinema._ Do I really need to genuflect before the silver screen to have a good time? Dip my fingers into a bowl of anointed popcorn butter and solemnly make the high sign to pass an arbitrary shibboleth? I just wanna go to the movies. Or watch them at home. Fill my soul with high art. Or kill an evening. Theatrical may be essential to the select, but it isn't to most. A commercial artist should go where the audience lives, and not, ya know, necessarily force them into a windowless room.

Next: "If you look at the streaming movies that do the best, they are the movies that come out in theaters first. So that should tell you something." Yes. It tells me theatrical releases get an unholy amount of support in terms of booking and advertising. (Mostly because if they don't, they're fucked.) This ties directly into his example of "The Ice Storm" as a smaller film with limited commercial prospects. I wish the interviewer had hit him with, "How do you advertise a movie like that in 2022?" Because Gray doesn't address workaday marketing costs, or talk about the difficulty in reaching a fractured audience across dozens of platforms, timezones, and locations.

Imagine if a studio took one of their blockbuster budgets and decided, well, let's produce 5 or 10 smaller films instead. They'd probably spend more money telling people about those movies than it cost to make them, and all that effort wouldn't lower their risk on opening weekend. Paramount tried a variation of this strategy around 2017, and stuck with it for 2 years. It lost them an estimated half a billion dollars. So why would anyone else do it? For art? For a bigger audience somewhere down the line? We're talking about movie studios here, and movie studios owned by conglomerates.

I suspect Gray knows this. In fact, I'm almost sure he does, because he tips his hand a little toward the end of the video, when he says, "TKTK."

as if it's still 1955 and we'll all go down to Schwab's after the picture show.
