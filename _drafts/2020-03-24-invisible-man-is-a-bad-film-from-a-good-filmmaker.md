Leigh Whannell's "The Invisible Man" is a rote domestic violence thriller with only a splash of sci-fi and horror. The characters are underwritten, the relationships and settings unestablished, and the scenarios implausible. The movie lacks detail when it requires authenticity and it lacks energy when it needs thrills.

The film is a reboot of a reboot, I guess, with Blumhouse Productions attempting to shove the age old Universal Monsters back in front of audiences after Tom Cruise's "The Mummy" imploded at the box office.

Anyway. "The Invisible Man" is in the mold of cheapy thrillers, where vulnerable women are put it perilous situations, made to suffer, and we are entertained. Think "Jennifer 8" and "Blink" from the early 90s and a slew of horror films from the late 70s. It's a formula that pays, sometimes even works: Cukor's "Gaslight" from 1944, or Young's "Wait Until Dark" from 1967.

But most of the time it's just dreary, as it is here, made drearier still because Whannell's hook is domestic violence with a nod toward #MeToo.

My two biggest problems:

For the first hour, the villain's actions don't require invisibility. They don't even require superhero-style abilities (which he somehow later adopts). I thought it was deeply silly that this guy's master plan involved sending mean emails and burning her breakfast.

The villain isn't a person or character. He's a special effect and a visually dull one at that. Plenty of better examples of screen boogeymen in other movies. Why did we need this guy? What does he do or say or think that makes him special or interesting? Outside the suit, that is.
