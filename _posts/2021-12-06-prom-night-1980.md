Why is Jamie Lee Curtis in "Prom Night"? Why is the killer dressed like [a stock photo burglar](https://www.gettyimages.com/search/2/image?family=creative&phrase=burglar)? Why is the school so lame, and every kid a square? Why does Leslie Nielsen's character disappear? Why did they include a romance unconnected to the rest of the story? Why why why? Watching this turned my face into [Swan's reaction meme](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Confused+Reporter+Jonathan+Swan&iax=images&ia=images).

 "Prom Night" borrows from better movies, and doesn't offer anything new in the borrowing. The script grabs ideas from "Black Christmas," "Carrie," and "Halloween," and drops them unchanged into a new suburban nowhere. So again with the same kids at the old school, and the wide, leafy lawns, and the same neatly lined streets with no traffic. And again with the big night as right of passage, complete with bad music and awkward celebration. Dumb jocks, mean girls, fat nerds. Then an escaped lunatic, because it's horror and somebody saw that in a movie once, and creeper calls to teen girls, because somebody saw that, too. The ending is stab, stab, run, run, reaction shot, corn syrup.

I get tired.

Jamie Lee Curtis stars, but not really.
