- Slight but effective movie abou urban lonliness, midlife regret, and the writing life that occasionally hit a little too close to home

- Great characters, terrific performances by McCarthy and Grant. 

- I liked the moment when the bookseller unknowingly quotes a line from a Lee forgery back to Lee, and the pained look that comes across McCarthy's face. 

- A lotta on the nose dialogue with the ex-lover and in court. I had a hard time believing someone like the Lee Israel depicted here would suddenly develop loads of self awareness in final leg of her story. 

- There was something missing here. It's not a crime or caper movie and most of the plot beats were covered in the trailer. But I think it needed some other element to win me over, because what it says about lonlieness is too explicit and what it says about writing isn't, frankly, all that interesting. (eg: At one point Lee says, defiantly, "I was a better Dorothy Parker than Dorothy Parker," which is a good line but lacks context within the film. As the audience, the film doesn't tell us enough about who either of these women were *on the page* for us to make our own judgement, or for the moment to have more weight than a one-off laugh line.)
