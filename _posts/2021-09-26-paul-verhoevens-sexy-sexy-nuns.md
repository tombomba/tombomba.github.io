Too many contemporary critics are smug when they should be thoughtful. Case in point: The [#filmtwitter response](https://twitter.com/search?q=benedetta%20protest&src=typed_query) to a small protest outside the NYFF showing of "Benedetta," Paul Verhoeven's [lesbian nun movie](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=verhoeven+benedetta+trailer).

A dozen or so Catholics from a right-leaning fringe group made noise this Sunday afternoon. Right outside a movie theater. One guy carried a megaphone. A snare drum was involved, possibly bagpipes. Protestors held signs reading, "I'm Catholic. Stop attacking my faith" and "Why the endless insults to Jesus?"

It was an insignificant rally, and quickly became [publicity](https://twitter.com/TheNYFF/status/1442193742396465155) for the film. Nobody blocked access to the venue. A riot did not erupt. (The middlebrows still appreciate peaceful protests, don't they?) While it's easy to make assumptions, to [point and laugh](https://twitter.com/TomiLaffly/status/1442202169386536961), not every spiritual person with a placard is a member of a hate group. They may even have a point.

If another movie treated Islam or Judaism as a cheap magic show, as a source of prurient interest, I imagine these same critics would demand retractions and apologies. They wouldn't hesitate to beat their social media pulpits with self-righteous fury. When it comes to Catholicism, though, there's no problem. You can take the cheap shot knowing no one will object.

One stringer raised an inadvertent point when [she said](https://twitter.com/TomiLaffly/status/1442198523198337025), "Bunch of loonies protesting BENEDETTA outside Alice Tully Hall now. Bought my tix as soon as I heard itâ€™s a sexy nun movie---can't wait." She meant to be clever, if not superior, but there's a whole worldview packed into her tweet, one predicated on the idea that buying a movie ticket is a political act.

The 'sexy nun' exists somewhere between fetish object and power fantasy, with unexamined baggage all her own, and she often walks a line between female empowerment and exploitative trash. The trope is admittedly the movie's one big draw. (Without the obvious taboo, would anyone attend?)

The same story about two priests wouldn't have sold to a distributor, because movies featuring homosexual men rarely go mainstream. If it had sold, nobody would be gleefully posting about it, as contemporary film culture doesn't champion gay men in quite the same way it champions gay women. If "Benedetta" were an earnest meditation on religious life, the public interest would approach zero, and the pageview-driven media would follow.

I'm tired of critics who'd rather be glib than empathetic. Who call themselves journalists, and see a story play out in front of them, but don't ask questions. Who are proud to have a narrow perspective. And I'm especially tired of the gamesmanship that surrounds film culture. The "Benedetta" discourse is already tired, and it's barely begun.
