    <p>There are quite a few crix out there who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This site is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express things I don’t see routinely expressed.</p>

  <p>My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around NYU’s cinema studies program before I “dropped out of college to get an education.” I’ve spent my time since producing digital media.</p>

  <p>I’ve never won any prizes. I’ve never been published. I don’t have a byline to show you. But I watch, read, think, and write a lot and maybe that’s something.</p>

  <p><em>{{ site.title }}</em> was created on a Macintosh using Jekyll, Atom, and Pixelmator while listening to KCRW Los&nbsp;Angeles.</p>
