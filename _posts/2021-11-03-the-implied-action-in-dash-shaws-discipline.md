I like the implied action in [this page](https://the-comics-journal.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/discipline-4.jpg) from Dash Shaw's new ["Discpline"](https://www.tcj.com/reviews/discipline/) (New York Review Comics, 2021). There's only a handful of figures present, some duplicated, but the movement remains coherent. No beats lost between the top left and bottom right, the layout mimicking a page of text. Shaw achieves his effect without panels, dialogue, or sound. From what I understand, the whole book is drawn to a similar style. All 304 pages. I don't know if that works at scale (or if such a thing could legit be called a comic, or a graphic novel, or enters into some new territory), but goddamn it's glorious in a single view. One page, and something to think about.
