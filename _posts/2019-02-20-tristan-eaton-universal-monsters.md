The work is visible [on the studio backlot](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/universal-unveils-giant-monster-mural-studio-lot-1187388) and features Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, The Bride of Frankenstein, the Wolfman, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Eaton spent the better part of a month completing the project. While based in Los Angeles, his art has appeared in cities and museums around the world, and his style is immediately recognizable. Personal faves: ["I Was a Botox Junkie"](https://tristaneaton.com/eastward/22saac2einxnuia1tfkbx8ua726gc0) in downtown L.A. and ["America Needs Brains!"](https://www.instagram.com/p/BRAPNIulAYY/) in Culver City.
