  Kenneth Branaugh's "Belfast" simultaneously wants to be part coming of age tale and part political document. It's not enough of either.

Kenneth Branaugh made a movie about working class Irish during The Troubles and shot the whole thing as if it were an Italian art house picture. That's certainly a choice, I suppose. His "Belfast" (Focus Features, 2021) is a kitchen sink drama, but modern and slick, with hard edges removed and everything made clean. It concerns, or seems to concern, one family's decision to leave Ireland amidst the sectarian violence of August, 1969. I say "seems to concern" because although many things happen over the movie's 97 minutes, that's the only personal conflict in it. A sorta provincial will they or won't they. (You may already know if you're familiar with Branaugh's life, as the film was written and directed by him and inspired by his childhood.) The rest is episodic. "Belfast" simultaneously wants to be part coming of age tale and part political document. It's not enough of either.<!--more-->

 Branaugh focuses his movie on Buddy, a Protestant boy living in Belfast, who operates as the writer-director's narrative proxy. We can only see and understand what Buddy sees and understands; the film's point of view is limited to that of a 9 year old. That choice hobbles the film, and invariably leads to awkward sequences where the kid must duck behind fence posts and stairwells so the audience can overhear bits of exposition as Buddy eavesdrops on his parents. Other scenes feature news reports in the "fighting broke out today in..." style, playing over radio and television in the background, with the information presented as period flavor, the outside world curiously removed from the family's day to day worries. "Belfast" never tells you much about Belfast, because Branaugh reduces Northern Ireland's political and social complexity to a single street in a single city, and he's too carefully neutral in his depiction of it.

The kid, played by Jude Hill, is immediately likeable. Branaugh imagines him as an empty headed saint, precocious in the gentlest way. Buddy fudges his homework for a chance to sit closer to a girl in his class (and later, shyly offers her flowers). He's unfailingly polite, and speaks with the same friendly enthusiasm to everyone, regardless of age or station. He never curses. He never talks back. He has a customary interest in toy cars and television shows (Matchbox and "Thunderbirds," mostly). When he shoplifts, it's only because he's roped into it by his peers, not because he covets anything for himself. He's blameless and a little boring, and I wonder if Branaugh himself was so dull as a child.

Caitríona Balfe is perfectly comfortable in setting and period as Buddy's mother. (She has a chameleon-like quality; I didn't recognize her despite having watched 2 seasons of "Outlander.") Judi Dench and Ciarán Hinds are very good together as Buddy's grandparents, and there could be an entirely separate movie in their lives and relationship. Lara McDonnell is notable as an impish girl from the neighborhood (although the actress is playing young, she's too mature to convincingly be the schoolyard chum to a little boy). Jamie Dornan is Buddy's father, a man with hard choices to make. The movie's appeal rests on the ensemble, on these charming Irish playing charming Irish. There are scenes that feel like a small wink and a gentle smile, but continuously, and again, and it works as long as you never consider the world of these characters.
