["Love is the message, and the message is Death"](https://www.moca.org/program/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death) is a collection of found images, news broadcasts, Getty archives, dashcam reels, and video clips, edited and arranged by Arthur Jafa, set to Kanye's ["Ultalight Beam,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oHdAA3AqnE) and made into a work of extraordinary art.

Jafa is a cinematographer and artist who has worked with Spike Lee, Julie Dash, and Jay-Z. "Love is the message" was acquired by the Hirshhorn Museum along with the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2018. It is playing in [virtual screenings](https://hirshhorn.si.edu/news/press-release/love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death-streamed-june-26-28/) at 13 museums this weekend.

The film is a history lesson about Black experience in seven minutes and thirty seconds. It is not easy to watch. It reflects private joy and public brutality, the famous alongside the obscure. The footage, in some cases, is all too recent.

One moment will stick with me: A close-up of a young woman riding silently in a car and looking straight at the camera. Her expression doesn't change but her gaze travels for a mile and a year, and keeps going, her face the face of someone who has seen too much in too short a time.

She doesn't need to speak for you to know.
