{% capture bio %}
This website is my 1,000 piece puzzle on the dining room table, my model airplane in the den, my handmade canoe in the garage. I began working on it years ago, to join what seemed vital online conversation, and return now in fits and starts.

My name is Tom Bomba. I once flirted with NYU's cinema studies program but found that words like _filmic_ and _split diopter_ made me cringe. My interest in the movies remains with writing, with story and characters, and not _mise-en-sc√®ne_.

_{{ site.title }}_ is intentionally basic, the design a mental note to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. The name is meant to be tongue and cheek.

Everything here was built on an old Macintosh using VS Code and Pixelmator, while listening to KCRW Los Angeles.
