Why is Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie? Why is the killer dressed like a stock photo burglar? Why is the school so lame, and every kid a square? Why does Leslie Nielsen's character disappear? Why include a romance unconnected to the rest of the story? Why why why? Watching this turned my face into a [reaction meme](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Confused+Reporter+Jonathan+Swan&iax=images&ia=images).

 "Prom Night" borrows from better movies, and doesn't offer anything new in the borrowing. The script takes ideas from "Black Christmas," "Carrie," and "Halloween," and drops them unchanged into a new suburban nowhere. So again with the wide, leafy lawns, the two story colonials, the same kids at the old school, and again with the big night as right of passage. Then another escaped lunatic. More creepy phone calls. Dumb jocks, mean girls, fat nerds. Night falls and it's stab, stab, run, run, reaction shot, corn syrup.

I get tired.

Jamie Lee Curtis stars, but not really.
