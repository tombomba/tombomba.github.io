Written like a sitcom, and one cancelled after half a season. The movie peddles hoary clich√©s about country life and city folk, the humor is flat and uninspired, and the characters aren't developed beyond a single punchline. 

Writer-director (and star!) B.J. Novak's Ben Manalowitz is too shallow; his decision to fly from New York to Texas for the funeral of an old fling is unmotivated. Ben's choice to turn her family's tragedy into a podcast event is ghoulish and funny, but the script is written low, built on weak jokes, and delivered with laugh track timing.

The dead woman exists primarily as a hook, the reason for Ben to be in Texas. Open questions about her only serve to push him through the story. This sort of casual fridging isn't uncommon, but I tend to roll my eyes at teary monologues and violent outbursts motivated by a character so underwritten she barely registers. For the climax to pay off, she needed to full fleshed. 

Her family receives slightly better treatment. They're one-note, broad cariacture, but I guess something is better than nothing. The actors are mostly stuck, and behave as if they're trapped in a "Hee Haw" reboot by way of "Saturday Night Live."

It seems Novak and his fictional counterpart are both willing to cynically exploit regional stereotypes to boost their careers. Ben with a "Serial"-style podcast, B.J. with this film. One of them realizes his mistake. The other does not. Seeing the climax play out hangs a strange meta over the movie, as you watch a character gradually exhibit more self-awareness than his creator.
