[Critics fancast](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/actors-next-james-bond-dev-patel-idris-elba-henry-golding-1202047287/) Idris Elba, Henry Golding, Daniel Kaluuya, Shazad Latif, Dev Patel, Robert Pattinson, and Colin Salmon in the role of the world's most famous spy.

These are surprisingly good picks. I never would have thought of half these actors, especially Shazad Latif, lately appearing on "Star Trek: Discovery." Henry Fielding, too. He has something of a lighter persona, as seen in "Crazy Rich Asians," and I can imagine him approaching the role the way Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan did.

That said, I'm something of a 007 traditionalist. I have a few sticking points on who plays him. One is that the actor needs to be a subject of the Queen, or the next best equivalent, a citizen of the Commonwealth. Bond is an icon and, when he first appeared, a point of pride for a country with a fading Empire and numerous espionage-driven scandals. Casting outside the realm would be unseemly, like having a Brit play Superman...

Another point is that Bond must be under 45 years old, which author Ian Fleming described as the "mandatory retirement age" for agents with the double-O designation. The character is a male power fantasy. Virility writ large. I can't watch Bond dodder around far-flung locales, played by a pensioner.

Race, in this case, doesn't matter. Fleming pictured Bond's appearance as similar to actor and musician Hoagy Carmichael (see inset, above). But ethnicity isn't inherent to the character and Bond's background is only briefly drawn over the course of a dozen novels.

Within that field I'd pick Daniel Kaluuya. He is both young and London born, with enough range to do the job. "Get Out" proved he can do light and charming and "Widows" demonstrated he can play stone cold. "A skinny Bond," as a friend termed it, would be a nice contrast to Daniel Craig's beefier take. Kaluuya might bring a new sensibility to the role and offer real competition to the likes of Bond's American cousins, such as Jack Ryan, Jason Bourne, and John Wick.
