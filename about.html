My name is Tom Bomba. I have no bylines or awards to show you. I am neither journalist nor critic, and I've never been on staff. I am another rando on the internet, starting from nowhere, and wanting to speak.

<i>{{ site.title }}</i> is a site about the west. About American mythology through media. The rough borders of my interest stretch from the Mississippi to the Pacific, up through the Yukon, down to Panama, and maybe a little further.

So, yes, this is another a site about movie and books, but also art and design and advertising, where and when I can manage it, and viewed through a geographic lens.

I hope you enjoy it.
