{% capture bio %}
This website is my 1,000 piece puzzle on the dining room table, my model airplane in the den, my hand made canoe in the garage. I began working on it years ago, to join what seemed vital online conversation, and return now in fits and starts.

My name is Tom Bomba. I once flirted with NYU's cinema studies program but found that words like _filmic_ and _split diopter_ made me cringe. My interest in the movies remains with writing, with story and characters, and not _mise-en-sc√®ne_.

_{{ site.title }}_ is intentionally basic, the design a sorta mental note to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. The name is a derived from my own.

Everything here was built on an old Macintosh using VS Code and Pixelmator, while listening to KCRW Los Angeles.
