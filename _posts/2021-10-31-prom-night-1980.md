Why is Jamie Lee Curtis in "Prom Night"? Why is the killer dressed like a stock photo burglar? Why is the school so lame, and every kid a square? Why does Leslie Nielsen's character disappear halfway through? Why did they include a romance unconnected to the rest of the story? Why why why?<!--more-->

 "Prom Night" borrows from better movies, and doesn't offer anything new in the borrowing. The script grabs ideas from "Black Christmas," "Carrie," and "Halloween," and drops them unchanged into a new suburban nowhere. So here we are again with the two story colonials, and the wide lawns, and the safe streets with no traffic. With the same kids at the old school. The halls fill with dumb jocks, mean girls, fat nerds. A fight breaks out between classes! Somebody gets sent the principal's office! Then the big party as right of passage, complete with bad music and awkward dancing. A lunatic escapes from an asylum, a creeper freaks out teen girls over the phone. Somebody plans to ruin the prom queen's big night. And so on, and so on, but paler and dumber in this version than the original sources.

Jamie Lee Curtis stars, but not really.

The ending is stab, stab, run, run, reaction shot, corn syrup.
