## Memories of Murder (2003)

First there's a body. Then another. Two detectives approach the case from different angles. One is a brawler who beats confessions out of suspects. The other is an analyst who works the evidence. "Memories of Murder" is a Korean true crime drama that makes other procedurals look phony by comparison. The story takes place over a five year period, from about ’86 to ’91, a time when the country moved from dictatorship to republic. There are dark scenes here, but not exploitation. The movie lives in its quiet moments, in its stark images, in its sense of lyrical macabre; a summer rainstorm, a figure in the dark, a body in the grass. As the detectives follow one lead after another, they put together pieces that refuse to form a whole. Years pass, more die, and still they continue. The experience changes them and the way the film relates that change tells us as much about a country as it does about a crime.

## The Road Warrior (1981)

I saw "The Road Warrior" once on a big screen, complete with surround sound, and every surface in the theater---including the concrete floor---vibrated to muscle cars and shitkicker bikes racing down a post-apoc wasteland. It's a minor-key tune played with metal and bone, with an ending that hums along on diesel and blood. You can scratch it up, pan and scan it, shove it onto a pocket sized screen, or display it on a cheap teevee. Doesn't matter. "The Road Warrior" will still run you over.

## Alphaville (1965)

Nunc hendrerit finibus volutpat. Curabitur ut dolor ac leo gravida sagittis condimentum ac nisi. Maecenas eu fringilla ligula. Vestibulum sit amet dapibus eros. Nam vitae nulla condimentum, eleifend enim tincidunt, porta nibh. Vestibulum fermentum lacinia ultricies. Cras facilisis porta tempus. Aliquam a leo vitae elit faucibus varius. Nunc hendrerit finibus volutpat. Curabitur ut dolor ac leo gravida sagittis condimentum ac nisi. Maecenas eu fringilla ligula. Vestibulum sit amet dapibus eros.

## The Lives of Others (2006)

East Germany, 1984. In the corners of a larger story, a playwright visits his favorite director. Both are well-known and acclaimed, or were, until The Party blacklisted the director from the stage. He tells the playwright, "In my next life, I'll simply be an author. A happy author who can write whenever he wants." For now, the director spends his time alone drinking bottles of wine. The playwright says there's a good chance the ban will be lifted. He spoke to the Minister of Culture himself. "Really?" the director says, "That's great." The room grows quiet. They know equally well that the Minister will never help, just as they know that the director's reaction is mere pleasantry. In the GDR, without such lies there is no hope.

## Repo Man (1984)

Listen. The typical H-wood film gets to the plate and hits a ground rule double and takes the bases as it should. ("Solid effort, solid effort," the auds intone as they clap with the crix.) You won't get any of that here. "Repo Man" isn't even on the field because it's not in the ballpark. It's outside, in the lot. Stealing your car.

## The Last Unicorn (1982)

After the studios fell apart and Walt died, the world of animation went a little crazy, producing titles like "Fantastic Planet," "Fritz the Cat" and "Heavy Metal." Like the whole scene ran as fast as they could to attempt something genuinely new and plainly weird. "The Last Unicorn" was made at the tail end of that renaissance, and in my mind it is forever paired with stuff like Bakshi's "Wizards" and Rosen's "Watership Down"---dark, violent, melancholy features that didn't know whether they were for curious kids or stoned adults.

## The Hills Have Eyes (1977)

Oh yes. Nuked-out mutants descend upon an unsuspecting family trapped by the side of a lonely road. "The Hills Have Eyes" is pure experience, raw and ugly from start to finish, and unrelenting in its use of violence. It's also a trash masterpiece, a piece of late 70s exploitation made with dangerous skill. This movie crawled out of the desert and punched me in the face, and I came away bruised but energized.
