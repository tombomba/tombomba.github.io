{% capture bio %}
This website is my puzzle on the dining room table, my model kit in the den, my canoe in the garage. I began working on it years ago, to join what seemed vital online conversation, and return now in fits and starts.

My name is Tom Bomba. I once flirted with NYU's cinema studies program but ran when I heard words like _filmic_ and _split diopter_ around campus. My interest remains with writing and not so much with _mise-en-sc√®ne._

_{{ site.title }}_ is intentionally basic, the design a mental note to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. It was made using VS Code and Pixemator while listening to KCRW Los Angeles.
