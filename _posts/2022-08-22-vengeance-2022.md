Like a sitcom episode, and one from a show cancelled after half a season. "Vengeance" is a fish-out-of-water story, about a New York writer in Texas, and it regurgitates every clich√© it can about city versus country. Most of the jokes are weak, and the characters are never developed beyond their last punchline.
