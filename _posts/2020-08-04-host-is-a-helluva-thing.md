A good ghost story will make me look over my shoulder when it's over. The good ones leave behind a sorta psychic residue I can't shake easily; they creep me out. So I glance back, you know, just in case.

As the credits played on "Host," I did that, and also kept my head down, and paced around my apartment, and mumbled "that was fucked up" each time a different scene flashed through my mind.

"Host," directed by Rob Savage and co-written by Savage, Gemma Hurley and Jed Shepherd, might be the best horror of the year, because it's scary, thrilling, and entertaining.<!--copynote-->

The premise is simple, almost tired. A group of women meet for a s√©ance, and because it's a horror movie, everything goes terribly wrong. The twist on formula is they're in lockdown due to coronavirus, and none are in the same room. The action takes place over Zoom, the teleconf software, and we see everything they see through the cameras on their laptops.

The movie is short at 56 minutes, and the writing, direction, and editing, are exceedingly clever. There's a high amount of creativity and discipline here, as the story moves effortlessly from a bunch of chicks goofing around about spirits to being actively terrorized by demons.

"Host" delivered an experience I had as a kid, after I breathlessly survived another foray into one of those cheesy summertime haunted house rides: the strangely life affirming feeling of being terrified, and loving it, because my brain was aware of the fantasy but my gut wasn't.
