I don't know anything about anything, but if you're making a movie about kids and the '70s and music and calling it ["Licorice Pizza"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofnXPwUPENo) and you're not matching Harry's [energy and allure](https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/debbie-harry-unseen-pictures), right here, snapped by Chris Stein, if you're not at that level, if you're peddling another sentimental coming-of-age story with "Life on Mars," my God, what are you even doing? Bad judgement on my part, I know. Too quick. I haven't seen the movie and no one has. Alls I've seen is the trailer, so how can I say with confidence? You're right. I can't. But then I think about the photo and I think about the movie, the infinite possibilities of the one and the limited possibilities of the other, and I'm back to...what are you even doing?
