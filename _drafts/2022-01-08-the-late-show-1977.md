A good little show, with a vibe straight from the pulps. Art Carney plays Ira Wells, an aged private detective in Los Angeles. Lily Tomlin is Margo Sterling, a New Hollywood flake who dogs him about a cat. The plot is appropriately complex and builds to a satisfying finish. The movie is worth watching if you're a fan of either Carney or Tomlin, or neo-noirs from the 1970s.

"The Late Show" has a TV cast and a TV title and sometimes a movie-of-the-week feel. The scope is small. A half dozen characters worry over a mystery that means nothing to nobody. Carney's detective becomes involved when a friend appears on his doorstep dying of a gutshot. Soon after, Tomlin's Margo asks him to find her lost cat. The story kicks up when a pair of goons arrive at Ira's rented rooms looking for Margo, then suddenly turn on each other and begin shooting. One guy falls dead on the front lawn, the other bolts, and then...

Wait, somebody really get shot over a missing cat? Yes and no. One of the film's pleasures is in how writer-director Robert Benton fleshes out the larger story, which includes home invasion, murder, theft, blackmail, adultery, and a small pile of double crosses. Ira discovers the dead guy on the lawn might be connected to a much uglier crime, and that ugly might've gotten his pal murdered. The script runs into occasional trouble when key players are referenced while never appearing on screen, making some points difficult to follow. If I had one big criticism of the film, it's that the ending payoff, the scene where the detective explains it all, might be unintelligible if you haven't been paying attention.

The movie's other pleasures are in its characters and stars. When Ira gets jumped following a lead, he threatens the guy who jumped him and he doesn't let it go. Carney offsets Ira's hard words with shaking hands and distracted gestures, layering anger over fear in a scene that would otherwise be boilerplate. Later, when Margo and Ira make progress on the case and he gives her a kind word, Margo reacts by filling the room with herself. Tomlin embraces the character's need, transforming Margo into a sorta human hummingbird as Ira shrinks from her. It's a moment that starts warm and goes cold and becomes warm again, where interplay matters more than dialogue.

The action is tame by today's standards, but the way Benson throws around blood packs and squibs, a quick punch and a fired gun have force behind them. There's also a measure of implied violence in the long blood trail Ira finds in an abandoned apartment, and in the nasty reveals around the home invasion at the center of the mystery.

The world of "The Late Show" is a seedy and broken, a version of Los Angeles that's about as unglamourous as you can get.
