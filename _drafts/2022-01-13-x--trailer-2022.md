Very [faux 70s grindhouse](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=trailer+x+2022+ti+west+a24). The visuals and scenarios look almost period boilerplate: blood, tits, and knives. Check, check, check. I hope the film will have a point of view, something to say, and won't merely regurgitate old exploitation tropes.
