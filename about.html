{% capture bio %}I wanted to do a western movie blog, but bigger and broader and not so stuck in time. Most of the sites around this subject are terrific, but reading them sometimes feels as if the world stopped in the mid-1970s, when public interest in the genre waned.

I'm also interested in material that mixes genres, displays a keen sense of place, or that takes North American culture and re-interprets it. So I may talk about "Mad Max" and "Coup de Torchon" alongside "The Searchers" and "Red River." Occasionally, I'll cover an obscure Yugloslav road movie, or some Italian skin flick, because there's no point in having a movie blog if you can't post about good movies. 

My name is Tom Bomba. I'm not anyone you know. I've knocked around here and there, and currently live west of the Mississippi. But really, I'm just another guy on the internet who likes what he likes and likes talking about what he likes. That's it.
