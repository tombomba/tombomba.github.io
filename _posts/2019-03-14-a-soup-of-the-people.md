"Across the globe and throughout time, I have stoked the fires of hungry appetites. And for it, I have become a soup of the people, a soup of honor, a soup of great fame."

Umami's ["The Cycle of Life"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uraG-z0grkc) is the strangest thing I've seen this year.

There are shades here of MTV's old ["Liquid Television"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mtv+liquid+television) and I will always have a soft spot for esoteric work that looks fast and cheap but isn't. With this, Umami intentionally clutters their video with audio pops and animated grain; frames are nearly static; the dialogue and the music is heavy, faux-profound, but played so straight it can't be anything but silly.

As for subtext---who the fuck knows? "The Cycle of Life" resists interpretation. Maybe Umami is saying something, maybe they're not. To look too closely is to miss the point, if there is any point at all. I sorta love that about it. Sometimes there's pleasure in not understanding.
