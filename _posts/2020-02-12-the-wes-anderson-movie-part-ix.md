Everyone on the internet is required to have an opinion about [the trailer for "The French Dispatch"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcPk2p0Zaw4) so here's mine:

It's an ad for a Wes Anderson movie.

I don't know what "The French Dispatch" is about and I still don't after viewing the clip. It doesn't matter. Anderson lives in his own cinematic universe, sole proprietor of an arthouse franchise. This new one will find the same audience and achieve the same success as the one before, and the one before that, and the one before that.

Years past, critics and audiences thrashed directors for repeating themselves. Not so much anymore. Today, there's comfort in the same again. To watch the trailer is to experience his familiar beats, gentle voiceovers, quirky characters, and obsessive design. Anderson only continues inside the niche he created twenty years ago. As with all franchisors, perfect repetition is the goal. It's what draws the customer back to you.

This places Anderson in an odd position: an auteurist who is more craftsman than artist, who never grew as a writer or director. Once he defined himself with "Rushmore," there was no substantive change to the look and feel of his movies, to the why and how of his stories. This places his work in an odd position: there's little reason to debate the merits of one picture over another, to talk about the choices in "Moonrise Kingdom" versus the ones in "Grand Budapest," for example, and even his rabid followers stretch to do it.

David Ehrlich, film critic and apparent stan, isn't wrong when he [says](https://twitter.com/davidehrlich/status/1227660182555123713), "Complaining that Wes Anderson has made another Wes Anderson movie is like being mad at a bagel for having a hole in the middle."

Anderson's films are all of a very specific piece. But then I can't think of anything more boring than walking into a new movie by a named director and knowing exactly what I'm about to see.
