Simeon Kondev's "Hair Baby" is four odd minutes filled with nervous energy, shimmering lines, and propulsive characters. You kinda just have to watch it.

The film is like underground comix mixed with mainstream weird; its style evokes RAW magazine, Liquid Television, Zap Comix, and hand-printed zines. 

Chris Votek's sound design stands out as his foley effects take the place of traditional dialogue. Just as "Hair Baby" wouldn't work in other forms---four color on the page or live action on the screen---it wouldn't work with language, either.
