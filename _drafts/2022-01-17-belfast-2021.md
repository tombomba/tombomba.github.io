Kenneth Branaugh made a movie about working class Irish during The Troubles and shot the whole thing as if it were an Italian arthouse picture. That's certainly a choice, I suppose. His "Belfast" (Focus Features, 2021) concerns, or seems to concern, one family's decision to leave Ireland amidst the sectarian violence of August, 1969. I say "seems to concern" because although many things happen over the course of the movie's 97 minutes, that's the only drama in it. A sorta provincial will they or won't they. (You may already know if you're familiar with Branaugh's life, as this story was written by him and inspired by his childhood). The rest is episodic, a movie that simultaneously wants to be part coming of age tale and part political document. But it's not enough of either.<!--more-->

The decision to set it partially from the little boy's point of view hobbles the entire narrative because we can only know what he knows (and it breaks narrative POv a few times).

Can never quite decided where the focus should lie. There's a little bit about politics, a lot about coming of age, and a little bit about the power of movies.

Cast is charming and the little boy is cute as a button but for my money Caitriona Balfe is the only one who seems perfectly at home in the setting and period.

The middle then is too peaceful in a sense, and we get information about The Troubles over radio and television and through newspapers, but we don't see the day to day impact on the character's lives.

Instead, there's typical Hollywood drama with a main Bad Guy, a Protestant leader who pressures the Dad to join whatever group he's a part of. This is boring and too reduced. Too simple a representation of a complex problem.

The film is too carefully neutral and it's hard to believe that the kid, through his parents, teachers, friends, or wider community, wouldn't hold an opinion about his world, and wouldn't express it.
