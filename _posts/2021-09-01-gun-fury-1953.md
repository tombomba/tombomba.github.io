A revenge story with no juice. Has the earmarks of something better. Rock Hudson and Donna Reed in the leads, supported by Leo Gordon and Roberta Haynes. Young Lee Marvin with a coupla lines. Directed by Raoul Walsh. Shot in technicolor.

Hudson and Reed play a couple traveling west, about to be married and very much in love. Half way through the trip, their stagecoach is jumped by outlaws. She's kidnapped. He's left for dead. The rest of the movie is as you'd expect, with pursuits, escapes, and fights across the American southwest.

It's fine. It's serviceable. The script is well structured and packs a lot of story into an 80 minute runtime. There are no bad scenes. There aren't any great ones, either.

The biggest problem is that the characters are introduced, developed, and then abandoned in service of the plot.
