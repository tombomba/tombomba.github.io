> It was a magazine publishers distributing house and we stood at the packing table checking the orders to see that the quantities coincided with the invoices. Then we signed the invoice and either packed the order for out of town shipment or set the magazines aside for local truck delivery. The work was easy and dull but the clerks were in a constant state of turmoil. They were worried about their jobs. There was a mixture of young men and women and there didn't seem to be a foreman. After several hours an argument began between two of the women. It was something about the magazines. We were packing comic books and something had gone wrong across the table. The two women became violent as the argument went on.

> "Look," I said, "these books aren't worth reading let alone arguing about."
>
> "All right," one of the women said, "we know you think you"re too good for this job."
>
> "Too good?"
>
> "Yes, your attitude. You think we didn't notice it?"
>
> That's when I first learned that it wasn't enough to just do your job, you had to have an interest in it, even a passion for it.
