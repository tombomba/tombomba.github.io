I once raced over the hills of San Francisco, at night, in a beat-up Porsche Carrera, with a 25 year old French girl in the passenger seat, and the experience told me everything I needed to know about why men love powerful machines.

I didn't get that from "Ford v Ferrari," the new studio picture from James Mangold about the 1966 Le Mans road race. I mean, I didn't get that sense. The freedom of a good car on the right road, everything coming at you point blank, passing in a flick, the satisfying downshifts, the blood pounding and the silly grin.

Where was the joy? A sports movie needs to communicate why the participants love the sport. Hell, in a film about a car and a race, it should tell you why anybody likes _driving._ 

"Ford v Ferrari" is like a well illustrated diagram in an encyclopedia of engineering. There's a glossy beauty to it but not a memorable moment. Watching, a new spin on Hawks' old line occurred to me: It's possible for a movie to have no bad scenes, but no good ones, either.
