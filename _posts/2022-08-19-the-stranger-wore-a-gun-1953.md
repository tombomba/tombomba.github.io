Almost a proto-"Fistful of Dollars," with Randolph Scott playing bandits off against one another in a small Arizona town just after the Civil War. Director Andr√© de Toth delivers his usual flair on an obviously low budget, staging action sequences with a good, dangerous energy. "Stranger" doesn't take advantage of its premise, though, and the end result is muddled. The characters are never much more than broad archetypes lashed to the plot, their dialogue perfunctory and expected. A promising opening sequence, where Scott helps Southern outlaws sack Lawrence, Kansas, awkwardly connects to the rest of the story. Later, small events and whole conversations are referenced but not depicted, as if a reel went missing somewhere. Claire Trevor breathes real life into the otherwise thankless role of love interest. Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin do what they do, but they also did it better elsewhere.
