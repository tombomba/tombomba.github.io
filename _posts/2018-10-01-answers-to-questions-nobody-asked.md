I'm [not a critic]({{ '/about/' | prepend: site.url }}) but it's sometimes fun to answer questions put to them. So I cribbed this interview from [Who's Who in Reviews](https://www.rogerebert.com/chazs-blog/whos-who-in-reviews-table-of-contents) and substituted my own responses.

## Where did you grow up, and what was it&nbsp;like?
I grew up in a lily-white suburb exactly like every other lily-white suburb. Pick a dozen images from a typical family sitcom, add emotional accents from "American Beauty" and "The Ice Storm," mix in the aesthetic sensibility of "Pleasantville," and you got it. My hometown was pretty, clean, and---at least outwardly---dull.

## Was anyone else in your family into movies? If so, what effect did they have on your&nbsp;tastes?
My brother, because of what he watched and how he watched, made me think movies could be an art form, that they were worth talking about.

## What's the first movie you remember&nbsp;seeing?
"Star Wars." I remember sitting in the theater and seeing Darth Vader for the first time. I sucked in my breath, held it, and pushed myself as far back into the seat as I could go.

## What's the first movie that made you think, "Hey, some people made this. It didn't just exist. There's a personality behind&nbsp;it."
I read about "Return of the Jedi" in [_Starlog_](https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-080?q=return+of+the+jedi) and felt bad for the visual F/X guys. Working on the movie must've spoiled it for them, right? They'd never experience it fresh, opening day, like the rest of us.

## What's the first movie you ever walked out&nbsp;of?
"Joe Versus the Volcano." It was time to go when Abe Vigoda showed up in a grass skirt with a soda can tied to his forehead.

## What's the funniest film you've ever&nbsp;seen?
"Monkey Business." The bit where the Marx Brothers attempt to sneak through customs, each one pretending to be Maurice Chevalier, still gets me.

## The saddest film you've ever&nbsp;seen?
"The Third Man." It depicts a real human ugliness without glamorizing it. I want the world to be Holly Martins but it's Harry Lime.

## The scariest film?
"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre." I watched it alone and ran out of the room when Leatherface appeared. The image of him grabbing some girl, against the sound of a steel door opening and closing, freaked me out. It took a minute to calm down and keep watching.

## The most romantic?
"Before Sunrise" by way of "Lady Bird." The latter suggests love and attention are the same. The former is about a man and a woman who reveal themselves in conversation; they can only do so because they know they are being heard.

## What's the first TV show that made you think television could be more than&nbsp;entertainment?
David Lynch's "Twin Peaks." I was excited by how subversive it was and thought, gee, maybe television isn't _all_ crap. Maybe there are possibilities! A different approach to the medium! That was 28 years ago and no one has matched its sensibility, although Donald Glover and "Atlanta" have come close.

## What book do you think about or revisit the&nbsp;most?
"Tropic of Cancer" by Henry Miller. "A gob of spit in the face of Art"...and a leaf of grass in a Parisian gutter. I like that you can open to any chapter, any page, and hear Miller singing. It's also a huge fuck you to the Edwardians and the modernists, to class values and capitalism, and to middlebrow thought, written by a guy trying hard to escape same.

## What album or recording artist have you listened to the&nbsp;most?
I listen to the [radio](http://radio.garden/). This means I'll often recognize a piece of music without knowing anything about it.

## Is there a movie that you think is great, or powerful, or perfect, but that you never especially want to see&nbsp;again?
"Come and See," directed by Elem Klimov. It's beautiful and brutal. The emotional weight of it is too heavy to revisit.

## What movie have you seen more times than any&nbsp;other?
In my twenties I'd come home from a job I hated and watch "Get Shorty," "Goodfellas," or "Tin Men." One of those, every few days, for months. Which makes rough sense to me now---on one level, they're movies about work as a form of identity, about people conflicted between who they are and what they&nbsp;do.

## What was your first R-rated movie?
It would have been something like "Scanners" or "Driller Killer" on VHS or HBO. My friends and I watched horror movies as a sorta rite-of-passage. Somebody would host a sleepover, we'd wait until the parents went to bed, and then we'd put on the craziest thing we could find.

## What's the most visually beautiful film you've ever&nbsp;seen?
"Ju Dou," from Zhang Yimou, and one of the last three-strip technicolor films. His "Raise the Red Lantern" is nearly as pretty but of course the colors don't pop in the same way.

## Who are your favorite leading&nbsp;men?
John Wayne, because he's John Wayne. Guy Pearce, because he's good at playing characters who are out of their depth but not reduced by their circumstance.

## Favorite leading women?
Maureen O'Hara, because she punched John Ford in the face. Emily Blunt, because she's versatile.  

## Who's your favorite modern&nbsp;filmmaker?
Ben Wheatley. He gives no quarter. He doesn't pander. I like that I don't always like him and that he doesn't care.

## Least favorite?
I'm tired of Quentin Tarantino. He developed his style so narrowly it's turned to schtick. A definite mean streak appeared after "Jackie Brown," and his characters became more cartoonish as his movies became more violent.

## What film do you love that most people seem to&nbsp;hate?
"Alien 3," a bad movie with good ideas. The more you travel through its history, from discarded screenplays to assembly cuts, the more interesting it becomes.

## What film do you hate that most people&nbsp;love?
"Children of Men." Its hero is a try-hard cynic, its world an off-the-shelf dystopia, and I never bought the attempt at building suspense around a newborn.

## Tell me about a moviegoing experience you will never forget---not just because of the movie, but because of the circumstances in which you saw&nbsp;it.
I saw "There's Something About Mary" opening night, in a big theater with a packed audience. The crowd went wild for it. Just wave after wave of raucous laughter for 2 hours. It was pure catharsis, surrounded by strangers.

## What aspect of modern theatrical moviegoing do you like&nbsp;least?
That multiplexes have all the appeal of bus station waiting rooms.

## What aspect of moviegoing during your childhood do you miss the&nbsp;most?
The matinees. Sticky concrete and thin carpet. Flat soda and artificial flavor. Metal seats, barely upholstered and bolted to the floor. Single screens and wonky sound. Weekend afternoons that last forever.
