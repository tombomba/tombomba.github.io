Writer-director-star B.J. Novak played tourist in Texas a few years back and the result is "Vengeance," a light comedy without good jokes, believable characters, or strong locations. 

His alter-ego Ben Manalowitz is a cynical writer who travels from New York to Texas for the funeral of a half-remembered fling, a woman curiously named Abilene. Meeting her family, Ben seizes on the idea of turning her death into a "Serial"-style podcast event. He thinks it'll boost his career. It probably will.

Novak's script peddles in regional stereotypes, and the Texas presented here could be anywhere (and it is: the movie was principally shot in New Mexico). Outside Ben and his New York producer, the characters are all big hair and long drawls, caricatures waiting on their next laugh line. The actors do their best but they're trapped in what too often plays like a "Hee Haw" reboot crossed with a weaker season of "Saturday Night Live." 

After the funeral, Ben stays with Abilene's family, asks a lot of questions, and gathers material for his pod. Older brother Ty believes Abilene to have been murdered and he pushes Ben to help him investigate (this is his one character trait). Two other sisters are Paris and Kansas City, who want to be famous for being famous. The family's youngest is called El Stupido, but as Ty explains, "it's okay because he doesn't speak Spanish." Granny launches into an impromptu history lesson over dinner, and the payoff to the bit requires Ben to be ignorant of the Alamo. Novak is a Harvard educated writer, playing a Harvard educated writer. These are the jokes.

When Ben begins to go native and attempts to describe the countryside for an episode of his podcast, he finds he can't. Instead he stumbles over his words and yells, "It's beautiful!" into the mic. Anyone who has visited Texas, or seen it photographed in better movies, or read about it by way of the state's countless authors, knows the draw. But Novak doesn't attempt to meet any sort of social or cultural bar with the setting. His character's incoherence is too superficial an expression for such a storied place.

Ashton Kutcher plays a local record producer who knew Abilene while she was alive. Kutcher tries hard to give an authentic performance and he mostly succeeds. He's the only actor in the film comes across like he means what he says. Unfortunately, huge chunks of his dialogue are overwritten, sounding as if Aaron Sorkin were delivering a TED talk, the character's bullshit a form of white noise after the second or third go-round.

The record producer lives on a ranch outside Marfa, a place in the real world with a reputation as an artist's retreat. (There's a famously fake Prada store there, a little commentary on location-as-branding). Marfa is the rough equivalent of San Miguel de Allende or Provo or Aspen---small towns transformed into destinations by outside money. Putting Marfa in your down-home comedy is a little like setting a movie in Fresno and shooting it in Palm Springs.

The climax consists of teary monologues punctuated by violence. The movie wants us to believe Ben finally sees the value of Abilene's life and has come to mourn her death. Such a beat depends on the audience's investment in this non-character character, in a woman fridged before the story began. Novak never cared enough to write her as real, she barely registers beyond the plot, so why should we care now that the movie is ending?

Both writer-director and his fictional counterpart went to Texas and treated people and place as fodder for a vanity project. Ben eventually realized he was a schmuck for doing it. Novak never did. This hangs a strange meta on the back half of the movie, as the main character gradually exhibits more self-awareness than the person who created him.
