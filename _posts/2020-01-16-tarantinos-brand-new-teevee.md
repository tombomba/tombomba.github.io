[Quentin says](https://deadline.com/2020/01/quentin-tarantino-oscar-nominations-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-star-trek-bounty-law-tv-series-1202829629/) he wrote 5 episodes of "Bounty Law," the fictional show featured in his recent film "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," and plans to direct them. Where and when remain to be seen.

<!-- It'll never happen but wouldn't that be something? -->

Remember Tarantino lays claim to a lotta things. He's spoken, over the years, about the as-yet-unproduced "Kill Bill 3." He's expressed a desire to write and direct a horror movie (alongside a rumor New Line actively courted him for a "Friday the 13th" sequel). More recently, he successfully pitched a "Star Trek" movie to Paramount but remains uninvolved in the franchise. Now this, a new-but-old show.
