Story is about a big heist attempted during a zombie outbreak. Script by Joby Harold, who also wrote "King Arthur: Legend of the Sword." Netflix will take over from Warner Bros., where the project has kicked around since 2007. Snyder, for his part, sounds eager to work. 

I have my reservations (remember "Sucker Punch"?) but there's a kernel of a good idea here---about whether it's possible to commit a crime in a land with no law.
