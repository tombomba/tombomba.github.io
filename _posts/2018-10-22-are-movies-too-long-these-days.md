Let's make [a few distinctions](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/10/should-movies-be-shorter-1202014312/). Good Movies are as long as they need to be. Bad Movies are as long as you want, because you can always walk out. What's left is the Vast Middle: the thousand movies that make no impression and leave no memory.

It takes focus and discipline to operate in a short form. Commercial pressure and changing tastes means we might lose the movies---the 90 or 120 minute cinematic novella---to Netflix and Amazon, to the 10 episode formula, to binge watching and bloated tentpoles. These days we get too many studio pictures fattened by large casts and bulky set pieces, indies with sitcom premises teased out to feature length.

I don't know of a solution except for better writing, but then writing takes time. Every studio has the money for the next hot project but few have the time to make a Good Movie.
