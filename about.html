{% capture bio %}I wanted to do a western movie blog, but bigger and broader and not so stuck in time. I'm interested in material that displays a sense of place, or that mixes genres, or that takes North American culture and re-interprets it.

My name is Tom Bomba. I'm not anyone you know. I've knocked around here and there, and currently live west of the Mississippi. Really, I'm just another guy on the internet who likes talking about what he likes. That's it.

The logotype is set in Averia Serif Libre from Dan Sayers. The horseshoe icon was designed by Guilherme Schmitt for the Noun Project.{% endcapture -%}
