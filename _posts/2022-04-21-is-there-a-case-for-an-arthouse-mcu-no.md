No. Could never, would never. Disney produces at massive scale for the largest audiences. Marvel movies often function as pure spectacle, as 2 hour advertisements for the next big thing, and sometimes as loss leaders. Licensing motivates them more than box office, I think, and this informs the studio's  creative choices.<!--more-->

MCU fans don't show when MCU actors appear in other properties (eg: "Blackhat," "Snowpiercer," "Ghost in the Shell," "Cherry"). They won't even show for old Marvel characters in a new context. 20th Century Fox's "Logan" pulled "Thor: Dark World" numbers at the box office, despite showcasing popular stars in established roles.

But he's asking the wrong questions (or asking the right questions a decade too late). Disney wouldn't be willing to go smaller because there's no bottom line advantage to it, and their audience would grumble if they tried.

There's no bottom line advantage to going smaller. That ground is covered by television, and let's face it---no kid will dress as Moon Knight next Halloween, just as no adult wanted a doll of an aged Professor X suffering from a Kenner-sized dementia. Toys and tees drive the business. Licensing deals will always be more lucrative than box office, and that drives creative, sooo...no

Well, [the disconnect]. There's a persistent, romantic view of studio movies as singular expression, as one-off auteurist "art" made for the enjoyment of North American audiences. Not as global products limited by corporate bureaucracy, supply chains, quarterly reports, and earnings calls.
