{% capture bio %}
My name is Tom Bomba. I'm a rando on the internet who enjoys movies and novels with a strong sense of place. Give me Jack and Duke among the Monument buttes, again and again. Give me the Salinas Valley in California (where I know the names of secret flowers). Put me on the Chisolm Trail, or back with London in the far north. Give me locations I can live in and dream about and come back to. Then give me story and more story. Give me self-generated American mythology writ larger than large, telling us about ourselves but also telling on ourselves. Give me art or trash. Doesn't matter. I want to talk about a place, and the people there.{% endcapture %}
