This website is my 1,000 piece puzzle on the dining room table, my model ship in the den, my hand made canoe in the garage. I began working on it years ago, to join what seemed vital online conversation, and return now in fits and starts.

My name is Tom Bomba. I once flirted with NYU's cinema studies program, but found that words like _filmic,_ _split diopter,_ _Kubrickian,_ and _masterpiece_ made me cringe. My interest in the movies remains with writing, with story and characters, and not with _mise-en-scène_.

_{{ site.title }}_ is intentionally basic, the design a sorta mental note to myself not to write as if I'm submitting for publication. The name is a loose reference to work by Pauline Kael and Jeffrey Sconce.

Everything was built on an old Macintosh using VS Code and Pixelmator, while listening to KCRW Los&nbsp;Angeles. The various icons lying around are courtesy of Twemoji, an open source program supported by Twitter.

There are quite a few critics online who are smart and skilled and say interesting things. This website is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express ideas I don't see routinely expressed.

My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around NYU's cinema studies program before I "dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing various forms of digital media.
