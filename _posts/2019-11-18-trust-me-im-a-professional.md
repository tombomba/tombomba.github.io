On one hand, there's a desire to be a serious critic of serious films, the perfect reviewer of mainstream pap, ready with a good tweet that hovers between insight and #hottake.

On the other, there's an impish thought that says: the hell with all that. The media landscape is so fractured and ugly, the capture of trade and pubs by studios so complete, there isn't a point to reviews and profiles. In 2019, criticism is no longer a job but publicity sure is.

Why not binge watch "Frasier" instead, stopping only to screen cap every moment where Kelsey Grammer appears pantsless? Call it an 'art project' to assuage yourself. Tell people, with absurd confidence, that it's a form of media criticism, coming soon to an insta near you.

But no, of course you wouldn't do that. Don't be ridculous. It would be juvenile and bizarre. You want to be a serious critic of serious films, if only in your own mind.
