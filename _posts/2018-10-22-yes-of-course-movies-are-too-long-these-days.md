[Yes](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/10/should-movies-be-shorter-1202014312/), of course they are. There was no reason for something like "Avengers: Infinity War" or "Mission Impossible: Fallout" to be 2&frac12; hours long.

But let's make a few distinctions. Good movies are as long as they need to be. Bad movies are as long as you want because you can always walk out. What's left is the Vast Middle, the thousand movies that make no impression and leave no memory.

A lot of those are summer tentpoles, action flicks, and blockbuster wannabes. With bigger casts and more set pieces, little remains for character and story. Director James Mangold laid out the math when he talked about [franchise fatigue](https://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/the-business/james-mangold-on-logan-and-fighting-franchise-fatigue) last year:

> There are so many characters that each character gets an arc of about 6&frac12; minutes at best, and I'm not exaggerating. You take 120 minutes, you take 45 of it for action, what are you left with, divide it by 6 characters, you have the character arc of Elmer Fudd in a Warner Brothers cartoon.

Movies are longer because they're developed around trailer moments. It's tough to come in under 2 hours when your ending alone needs 30 minutes of wall-to-wall action.

Then there's perceived value. When color television debuted and Old Hollywood needed to compete, they churned out widescreen epics and advertised on new technology. The same strategy is at work today. To draw us from the living room, theatrical releases are sold as a premium experience---bigger screens, plush seats, better food, longer runtimes---to lend the feeling we've gotten our money's worth.

Time and space limit the bloat. Longer runtimes translate into fewer screenings per day, which impacts box office. To compensate requires additional screens---literally more theaters---but this has other, unintended effects. If the next "Star Wars" event takes up half the space at the local multiplex because it's 3 hours long, there's less room for an indie romcom, a low-budget horror, or an adult drama. Big movies starve little ones and they do it 20 or 30 minutes at a time.
