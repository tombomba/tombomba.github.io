{% capture bio %}
My name is Tom Bomba. I'm a rando on the internet who likes movies, novels, comics, and video games with a strong sense of place. So give me Jack and Duke among the Monument buttes, again and again. Give me the Salinas Valley in California (where I know the names of secret flowers). Give me Lone Pine and Warsong Gulch. Put me back on the Chisolm Trail, or with London again in the north. Give me locations I can live in and dream in and come back to. Then give me story and more story. A protagonist with values, good or bad. Give me self-generated American mythology writ larger than large, telling us about ourselves but also telling on ourselves. Give me art or trash. High culture or low. Doesn't matter. I want to talk about a place, and about people with something to say.{% endcapture %}
