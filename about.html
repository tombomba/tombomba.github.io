{% capture bio %}
My name is Tom Bomba. I once flirted with NYU's cinema studies program but found phrases like _split diopter_ and _mise-en-sc√®ne_ made me cringe. My interest in movies remains with writing, not the technicals. (Yes, I know it's a visual medium. Odd as it sounds, I've never gone to the pictures for the pictures. I've always gone for the story.)

I am not a journalist. I have no bona fides. But I do like to talk about the media I view, and so here we are. Whatever this site is now, and whatever it becomes, I hope you enjoy it.
