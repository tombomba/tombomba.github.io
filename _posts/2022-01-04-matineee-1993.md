Joe Dante's paen to 1950s horror, to movies and movie theaters, to the Atomic Era, and I don't know why or what for. The movie's okay. It's fine. But there's no compelling reason for it, either. Dante and screenwriter Charles S Hass take the safest route they can find through the material, and it's...you know what? Harmless. Soft hearted and rosey and fine family viewing. Which is weird for a movie about horror movies, a light comedy set during the Cold War. And also because Dante and Haas made "Gremlins II" together, a monster movie with the edgy exhuberance "Matinee" lacks and might've used.

The film headlines John Goodman as Lawrence Woolsey, a character in the spirit of B-movie impresario [William Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Castle). Woolsey makes schlock and promotes it tirelessly, and he employs similar gimmicks to Castle's: theaters rigged with extra sound and lighting effects, electronic buzzers in the seats, costumed extras running up and down the aisles, etc etc. He turns local theaters into carnivals and casts himself as barker, and approaches his potential audience with an exaggerated flourish. It's fun to see him work the crowd or promote himself in coming attractions. Goodman plays it fine, although the part is not much of a stretch beyond his other comedic roles.

Once Woolsey arrives in Key West to peddle "Mant," his newest atomic monster movie, right in the middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis, "Matinee" doesn't have much to say. How could it? It's tough to photograph somebody's unabashed love of the movies, or dramatize the act of watching a film. The script treats the Cold War as backdrop, as period tie-in. There's a few coming-of-age stories involving local teen boys and their romantic aspirations toward local teen girls, and these plots are well executed and well structured but ultimately shallow. "Mant," the film-within-a-film, is positioned broadly, as parody, which I think is a conceptual mistake. (If the filmmakers value schlock horror, then why present it as an unsophisticated joke? If they don't, then why make this film?) I want to like "Matinee" because it loves the things I love. As a comedy I smiled at it more than I laughed with it, and I spent most of the runtime thinking of other movies.
