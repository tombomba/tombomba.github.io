["Love Is the Message, and the Message Is Death"](https://www.moca.org/program/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death) is a collection of found images, news broadcasts, Getty archives, dashcam reels, and video clips, edited and arranged by Arthur Jafa, set to Kanye's ["Ultalight Beam,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oHdAA3AqnE) and made into a work of extraordinary art.

Arthur Jafa is a cinematographer and artist who has worked with Spike Lee and Julie Dash. "Love Is the Message" was acquired by the Hirshhorn Museum along with the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2018. It is playing in [virtual screenings](https://hirshhorn.si.edu/news/press-release/love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death-streamed-june-26-28/) at 13 museums this weekend. Seek it out once the world re-opens if you miss these shows.

"Love Is the Message, and the Message Is Death" is a Black history lesson in 7 minutes and thirty seconds. It depicts private joy and public brutality, the famous with the obscure. The footage, in some cases, is all too recent. It is not always easy to watch.

Yet you could make a photo book from Jafa's collection, each juxtaposition more striking than the last. His genius lies in placing Black pride next to Black pain and presenting both using only found objects and visual detritus.

One image will stay with me: A close-up of a young woman riding silently in a car, her expression unchanging. Her gaze goes to the camera and runs for a mile and a year, and keeps going, her face the face of someone who has seen too much in too short a time. She needn't speak to communicate her truth.

"Love Is the Message, and the Message Is Death" is like that, too, in the way it says something real and lasting without using words.
