- Standard biodoc with the usual home movies, press clips, and related interviews

- Great presentation breaking up McQueen's life into "Tapes" around his shows & career

- There wasn't much immediate subject material to work with and it shows -- lotsa grainy handcam footage

- But most of this doesn't matter because the subject shines through; McQueen himself is absolutely fascination. 

- Broken kid from working class London becomes independent artist, design superstar, rich as hell, and world famous.

- Interesting that McQueen always managed to maintain his autonomy, but I suppose genius allows for that. 

- The footage from the shows is almost shocking because of how dramatic, intense, and beautiful it is. The sets are elaborate, the movement carefully structured and time, the visuals distinct and perfect. The clothes! A riot of color and form. I gasped a few time because everything was *just so* and perfectly done but had an ethereal quality too. It was just idea after idea after idea, one aftet the other, and so much darker and personal that you'd expect from so-called high fashion. 

- One of the interviewees compared McQueen's work to sculpture, which sounds about right. 

- Another moment mentions he was doing 14 shows a year, which even with my limited knowledge of the industry is an *insane* amount of work for one person.

- The ending left me a little angry. How dare he -- selfishly I have to say what a huge, huge loss for the rest of us.
