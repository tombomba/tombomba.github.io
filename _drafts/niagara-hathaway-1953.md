Hathaway attempts Hitchcock. All the seeds are here, yet nothing grows. Marilyn Monroe plays a cruel, dupiclitous woman out to murder her husband. Joseph Cotten skulks around as her cuckolded spouse and would-be victim. Jean Peters, straight off "Pickup on South Street," is a conventional bride on her honeymoon, finding herself caught in the middle. You'd think you couldn't lose with that setup, but you can. The movie jumps from character to character, and changes tone often enough, that any potential tension is lost. We get a little of the story from Monroe, then a little from Cotten, then a little from Peters, and back again. There's no single perspective to get behind. No real build-up. No throughline. It ends with an expected big action climax, one a little too obvious given the film's setting.
