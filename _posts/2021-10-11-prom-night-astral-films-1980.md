title: "Prom Night (Astral Films, 1980)"
---

Features the lamest high school in the movies. Curtis attends prom dressed like somebody's grandmother. The male actors could all double for Willie Ames. The killer is dressed like a stock photo burglar. Outside one brief moment at the very end, it's dull as heck. Casually borrows from better movies, like Black Christmas, Carrie, and Halloween, and is so blandly produced it makes the F13 movies look absolutely artful.
