Almost a proto-"Fistful of Dollars," as Randolph Scott plays 2 bandit groups off against one another in a small Arizona town. The movie doesn't take advantage of its premise, though, and the script is muddled. A morally dark opening sequence with Scott helping Southern outlaws to sack Lawrence, Kansas doesn't have much effect on the rest of the picture. The characters are never much more than broad archetypes, lashed to the plot, their dialogue perfunctory. Some events and conversations are referenced but not depicted, and it's as if half a reel went missing somewhere. There's nice stylistic flourish and good staging courtesy of director Andr√© de Toth, along with 3D cheese and technicolor pop. The action sequences, mostly horseback chasing stagecoach through ravines and gullies, have real zing to them. Claire Trevor stands out as Scott's half-hearted love interest; she somehow brings a full inner life to a supporting part. Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin round out the cast, both doing what they do, but doing better work elsewhere in better roles.
