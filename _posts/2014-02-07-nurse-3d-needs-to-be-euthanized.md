"Nurse 3D" wanders away from its promos and its title from the first scene. The movie establishes its lead, Abby, as a 'black widow.' She targets healthy men, adulterers looking for an easy pick up. Abby "mates and then kills," blah blah, and none of her murders have much to do with nursing or hospitals. That's fine, I guess, but it's also sloppy and plays like a bait and switch.

Paz de la Huerta is the titular _(ahem)_ heroine, one who sports a plunging neckline, a short skirt, and a homicidal urge. She has the right curves to play a femme fatale but not the confidence. We see it in her face, in the way she walks, in the way she holds herself. Picture your kid sister wobbling in her first pair of heels. That's Paz in "Nurse 3D": Reaching hard to be someone else's idea of sexy. The character of Abby becomes unintentionally funny, a self-conscious personification of the male gaze.

The story shifts focus again when Abby becomes obsessed with Danni, a coworker. It becomes more about their relationship and less about Abby's black widow urges. By day, the two work at the local hospital. By night, Abby inserts herself into Danni's life, visiting Danni's stepfather on the sly and supporting Danni when a romance goes sour. Later, after a few bodies drop and the cops come around, Abby makes all the tramp-noir moves we'd expect—she sets up her friend to take the fall. "But you have to believe me," Danni tells the dubious officers in another scene that piles cliché on cliché, "She's lying!"

In one disturbing sequence, Abby roofies Danni and date rapes her. The movie glosses over this with quick cuts, overexposures, and super saturated stock. It wants you to see Danni high, leaning back with a smile as Abby snaps photos with her phone. In a film that objectifies women in the most obvious ways possible, this is gross stuff. The implications leave behind a residue, black and heavy and ugly, that throws off the movie's tone.

That tone is everything because "Nurse 3D" wants to be a throwback to 80s softcore cheese; a popcorn experience with plenty of sex and just enough violence. To do that, though, the movie assumes you are one hundred percent cooch lovin' dudebro. The camera lingers over every bit of female anatomy it can, as often as it can. You want a tit shot? Here's a tit shot. And here's another one, in case you missed it. Look, there's Paz with no pants. And hey, since it's been two minutes, here she is again in all her bare-assed glory. The effect, after awhile, is deadening. "Nurse 3D" confuses nudity with eroticism, a mistake that most porn is smart enough to avoid. The result feels totally clueless, devoid of real sex, like a movie conceived by virgins for virgins.

Thirty years ago, "Nurse 3D's" brand of Skinemax worked because young audiences lacked regular access to adult material. Today, any kid with a keyboard is five seconds away from the hardcoriest of hardcore. So who needs a movie selling Paz de la Huerta on the cheap?
