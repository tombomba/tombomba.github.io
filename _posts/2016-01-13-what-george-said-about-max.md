George Miller, at the [Globes](http://pagesix.com/2016/01/11/george-miller-will-never-make-another-mad-max-movie/):

> I won't make more "Mad Max" movies. [...] If you finish one in a year, it's considered a leap of faith. Start, stop, start again. I've shot in Australia in a field of wild flowers and flat red earth when it rained heavily forever. We had to wait 18 months and every return to the US was 27 hours. Those "Mad Maxes" take forever. I won't do those anymore."

Grain of salt. Page Six, the only source of this quote, is a gossip column. Miller has said different things at different times about the "Max" sequels. He told other interviewers that every character in "Fury Road" has a [deep backstory](http://www.topgear.com/car-news/movies/two-more-mad-max-films-coming-says-fury-road-director). That [two scripts](http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2015/10/06/George-Miller-has-two-Mad-Max-sequels-planned/4061444139118/) are already written. That [maybe Furiosa is in there](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/08/mad-max-fury-roads-george-miller-charlize-theron-imperator-furiosa-future-film). That [maybe she's not](http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a673073/mad-max-fury-road-sequel-wont-star-charlize-therons-imperator-furiosa/). That they're [talking to the studio](https://soundcloud.com/ewradio/george-miller-on-mad-max-sequel).

But also: That he wants to do something without many stunts or special effects for his next project. "Something smaller that's contemporary and that we can get through fairly quickly." This is understandable, as he is a 70 year old man who spent a chunk of his golden years working in Australian outbacks and African deserts.

Despite his comments, I can't see him walking away from Max unless he plans to retire. George Miller wrangled time and nature for 15 long years to make "Fury Road." The series is a map of his professional life. It is his legacy.

I can't see it working the other way round, either---a "Mad Max" film without Miller. Who else would have his commitment? These sequels aren't typical work for hire gigs. They are movies that require crazy in the blood. They need George.

**Update:** Rebecca Ford at THR [says](https://twitter.com/Beccamford/status/687658585497538560), "George Miller told me he didn't mean to say he wouldn't direct another 'Mad Max,' just that he hopes to do 'something small and fast' first."

So there ya go.
