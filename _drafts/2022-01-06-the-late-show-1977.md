"The Late Show" (Warners, 1977) is a good little show, with a vibe straight from the pulps. Art Carney plays an aged private detective in Los Angeles and Lily Tomlin is a New Hollywood flake who dogs him about a cat. The plot is appropriately complex and builds to a satisfying finish. The movie is worth watching if you're a fan of either Carney or Tomlin, or neo-noirs from the 1970s.

"The Late Show" has a TV cast and a TV title and sometimes a movie-of-the-week feel. The scope is small. A half dozen characters worry over a mystery that means nothing to nobody except them. Carney's detective becomes involved when a friend appears on his doorstep gutshot and dying. Later, Tomlin tries to hire him to find her improbably missing cat. Carney refuses, because who the hell would take that job? But she persists. "I get $25 a day plus expenses because I'm the best and I get paid like the best," he says, and despite looking like a moth eaten Marlowe, I believed him. The story kicks up when a pair of goons arrive at Carney's rented rooms looking for Tomlin, but suddenly turn on each other and begin shooting. One guy falls dead on the front lawn, the other bolts, and then...

Wait a sec, did somebody really just get shot over a missing cat? Yes and no. One of the film's pleasures is in how writer-director Robert Benton fleshes out the larger story, which includes home invasion, murder, theft, blackmail, and a small pile of double crosses. Carney searches for his friend's murderer (and Tomlin's cat) and discovers the dead guy on the lawn might be connected to an uglier crime, and that ugly might have gotten his pal killed. The script does run into trouble when key players are referenced in dialogue without ever appearing on screen; this renders some plot points difficult to follow.
