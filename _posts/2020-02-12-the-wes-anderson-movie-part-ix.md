Everyone on the internet is required to have an opinion about [the trailer for "The French Dispatch"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcPk2p0Zaw4) so here's mine:

It's an ad for a Wes Anderson movie.

I don't know what "The French Dispatch" is about but what it's about doesn't matter. Anderson lives in his own cinematic universe, sole proprietor of an arthouse franchise. This one will find the audience and achieve the success as the one before, and the one before that, and the one before that.

Years past, critics and audiences would thrash directors for repeating themselves. Not so much anymore. Nowadays, there's comfort in the same again. With all franchisors, repetition is the goal. Anderson succeeds inside the niche he created (cf: this trailer, with its familiar beats, gentle voiceovers, quirky characters, and obsessive design).

This places him in an odd position: an auteurist who is more craftsman than artist, who never grew as a director or a writer. Once he defined his style with "Rushmore" twenty years ago, there was no substantive change to the look and feel of his movies, to the why and how of his stories. This places his work in an odd position: there's little reason to debate the relative merits of one Anderson picture over another, say "Life Aquatic" versus "Grand Budapest," and even his rabid fanbase stretches to do it.

David Ehrlich, critic and stan, isn't necessarily wrong when he [says](https://twitter.com/davidehrlich/status/1227660182555123713), "Complaining that Wes Anderson has made another Wes Anderson movie is like being mad at a bagel for having a hole in the middle. Just take my money and give me one with everything."

But then I can't think of anything more boring than walking into a movie theater knowing exactly what I will see.
