Originally, I wanted to do a movie blog, add to the fray, contribute. Then I thought something around genre, maybe. Horror, or sci-fi, or schlock, or paracinema. But I discovered even the the nichiest of niches has too many rabid voices.

My name is Tom Bomba. I have no bylines, awards, or prizes to show you. I am another rando on the internet. I don't know what I'm doing but I know I want to do something, and speak.

I want to make a site about the west. About American mythology. The rough borders of my interest stretching from the Mississippi to the Pacific, up through the Yukon, down to Panama, and a little further.

So, yes, a site about movies and television and books, but also art and design and advertising, where and when I can, filtered through a geographic lens.

I hope you enjoy it.
