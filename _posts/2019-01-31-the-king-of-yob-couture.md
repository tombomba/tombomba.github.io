"McQueen," a documentary about fashion designer Alexander McQueen, who committed suicide at the height of his career, is a conventional film about an extraordinary man.

Because of McQueen's untimely death, the movie can't boast much in the way of primary sources. We see a lotta home movies, old interviews, press clippings. Talking head interviews with past loves, mentors and collaborators, some family.

What the film does have is a great subject. I am left wanting to talk about Alexander McQueen and what he achieved, not about this film as a film.

Lee Alexander McQueen was a broken kid from a working class family, who grew up on the wrong side of the wrong town, who turned himself into a something of a fashion protégé, shocked the industry, and became the head of two international couture houses while managing his own line. He did all this before the age of 30.

There's an appeal and an easy arc in the Alger-ish, rags-to-riches qualities of his life story. More appealing is his obvious genius. This comes through again and again when the film cuts to footage of McQueen's fashion shows in London and Paris. When we can see the clothes, how women moved in them, how easily he played with silhouette and color.

Early shows had titles such as "Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims" and "Highland Rape." His staging and execution were operatic and theatrical. (One of his models noted that McQueen had the eye of a film director.) The combined effects overwhelm, even in file footage, simultaneously celebratory and destructive. Fifteen, twenty years on and the work retains boldness and daring.

Filmmakers Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui are clever enough not to compete, presenting new material in a conservative form. During interviews with McQueen's contemporaries, we pay attention to the words, not the images. Their skill lies in structure, in the ways they contrast and complement McQueen's private and professional lives. This was a man who put his raw self on display, expressing his inner torment through cloth---many of his creations are beautiful and disturbing---and who did it at the center of a multi-billion dollar industry.

The film is less successful with how it handles McQueen's difficulties. It briefly touches on a troubled childhood, sudden breaks with his creative team later in life, and overwork, drugs, depression. It glides past his failures, such as his first show for Givenchy. McQueen was a towering, controversial figure in life and death. While he had critics and detractors, we don't hear from many of them. (One newspaper headline, briefly seen, calls him "The King of Yob Couture.")

I generally dislike documentaries that could easily play as eulogies, as little filmic, maudlin memorials. This one isn't quite that, but it's close. The difference again comes back to McQueen, and his work, which is so outstanding and smart and beautiful that it reduces all other questions and makes them negligible.
