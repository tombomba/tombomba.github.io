On one hand, there's a desire to be a serious critic of serious films, the perfect reviewer of mainstream pop, ready with a good tweet, always hovering between insight and #hottake.

On the other, an impish thought says: the hell with that. The media landscape is so fractured and ugly, the capture of trade mags and online pubs by the studios is so complete, there isn't a point to writing reviews and profiles, to building a career out of words and opinions.

Culture writing today is like basic cable with a busted remote, the television permanently stuck on the Home Shopping Network. Everything is a pitch for something else. Criticism is no longer a job but publicity sure is.

So forget it. Why not binge "Frasier" instead, stopping only to screen cap each moment Kelsey Grammer appears without pants? Call it an 'art project,' if you will. Tell people, with absurd confidence, it's a form of media commentary, coming soon to an insta near you.

But no, of course you wouldn't do that. Don't be ridiculous. It would be juvenile and bizarre. You want to be a serious critic of serious films, if nowhere else than in your own mind.
