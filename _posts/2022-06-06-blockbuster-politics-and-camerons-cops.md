Aaron Stewart-Ahn [gushes](https://twitter.com/somebadideas/status/1532899847048683520): "That he made his villain an icon of the L.A.P.D before the Rodney King tape was released, and then pushed it even harder in his script for Strange Days...What happened to blockbuster movies saying [fuck the police](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/terminator-2-commentary-policing/) as hard as James Cameron?"

Stewart-Ahn can't seem to recall a time before September, 2001. When the country leaned right, but not hard right. When our system was ugly, but not this ugly. He doesn't remember, or never knew, what happened in Los Angeles when Cameron was writing his scripts and making his movies.

Back then, [the L.A.P.D. killed a single mom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Eula_Love) in broad daylight. Years later, they instituted a policy leading to the harrassment and [arrest of some 50,000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Hammer_(1987)). So when he chose an L.A. police officer for his villain, it wasn't prescience. It was a reflection of what was already in the street and on the news.

There's a political angle there, sure. But the new terminator could easily have taken a different form without altering "Judgment Day's" larger story. That the T-1000 appears as a cop is a jab that might have been a hook in a film with more serious intentions. The character then is nothing more than a costume, a criticism with one thought behind it.

Bilge Ebiri [replied](https://twitter.com/BilgeEbiri/status/1533295627064451074) to Stewart-Ahn, saying, "It's funny how people have forgotten there was an actual controversy over how Cameron made the U.S. military the bad guys in Avatar."

There was no controversy, unless you pay mind to fringe websites and cranky periodicals. (Or, for some reason, wish to lend their ideas credibility by referencing a decade old, [imaginary beef](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Movies/politics-avatar-conservatives-attack-movies-political-messaging/story?id=9484885).)

"Avatar's" politics were implicit, because you can't write a story about one state invading another without being political. Yet their treatment was superficial, never the focus, just as with "T2." Cameron once again made it easy to ignore the message and enjoy the spectacle, rendering his movie's positions inconsequential.

Some of the sci-fi actioners that preceded "Avatar" ("Starship Troopers," "War of the Worlds") and some that debuted afterwards ("Winter Soldier," "Fury Road,") trucked in a similar style. Each combined an unsophisticated story with politics absent of meaning. This trend, whatever it is and however it takes shape in the future, may be Cameron's legacy.
