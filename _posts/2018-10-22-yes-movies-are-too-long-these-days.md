[Yes](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/10/should-movies-be-shorter-1202014312/), of course they are. There was no reason "Avengers: Infinity War" or "Mission Impossible: Fallout" needed to be 2&#189; hours long. But let's make a few distinctions. Good movies are as long as they need to be. Bad movies are as long as you want them to be because you can always walk out. What's left is the Great Middle, the wash of a thousand movies that make no impression and leave no memory.

A lot of those are summer tentpoles, action flicks, and blockbuster wannabes. With bigger casts and more set pieces, little remains for character and story. Director James Mangold laid out the math last year when talking about [franchise fatigue](https://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/the-business/james-mangold-on-logan-and-fighting-franchise-fatigue):

> There are so many characters that each character gets an arc of about 6&#189; minutes at best, and I'm not exaggerating. You take 120 minutes, you take 45 of it for action, what are you left with, divide it by 6 characters, you have the character arc of Elmer Fudd in a Warner Brothers cartoon.

Movies are longer because they're developed around trailer moments. It's tough to come in under 2 hours when your ending alone requires 30 minutes of action.

Then there's perceived value. When color television debuted and Old Hollywood needed to compete, they churned out widescreen epics and advertised on new technology like Cinemascope and Panovision. The same strategy is at work today. To draw us away from the living room, theatrical releases are sold as a premium experience---plush seats, better food, IMAX screens, longer runtimes---to lend the feeling we've gotten our money's worth.
