There are quite a few voices out there who are smart and skilled and interesting. This site is my attempt to join them. I made it for fun, but also to express things I don't see routinely expressed.

My name is Tom Bomba. I knocked around NYU before I "dropped out of college to get an education." I've spent my time since producing digital media.

<i>{{ site.title }}</i> is about American mythology. The rough borders of my interest stretch from the Mississippi to the Pacific, up through the Yukon, down to Panama, and maybe a little further.

While this is another blog about movies and books, it's one where pop art is viewed through an intentionally limited, geographic lens.

The site was created on a Macintosh using Jekyll, Atom, and Pixelmator while listening to KCRW Los&nbsp;Angeles. In typical fashion, I've revised this page 37 times and I'm still not satisfied with it.
