"Matinee" (Universal, 1993) is Joe Dante's paen to schlock horror, to movies and movie theaters, to the Atomic Era, and I don't know why or what for. The movie's okay. It's fine. But there's no compelling reason for it, either. Dante and screenwriter Charles S Hass take the safest route they can find through the material, and it's...you know what? Soft hearted and rosey and fine family viewing. Which is weird for a movie about horror movies, a comedy set during the Cuban Missile Crisis. And also because Dante and Haas made "Gremlins II" together, a monster movie with an edgy exhuberance "Matinee" lacks and might've used.

The film headlines John Goodman as producer Lawrence Woolsey, a character in the spirit of B-movie impresario William Castle. Woolsey makes schlock and promotes it tirelessly, and he employs similar gimmicks to Castle's: stages rigged with extra sound and lighting effects, electronic buzzers in the seats, costumed extras running up and down the aisles, etc etc. He turns local theaters into carnivals and casts himself as barker, and he approaches his potential audience with an exaggerated flourish. It's fun to see him work the crowd and promote himself in coming attractions. Goodman plays it well, although the part is not much of a stretch.

Once Woolsey arrives in Key West to peddle "Mant," his newest atomic monster movie, though, "Matinee" doesn't have much to say. How could it? There isn't enough room in the premise. Woolsey is a guy who loves movies, who believes in what he's selling. His customers are receptive. Where do you go from there? It's tough to photograph someone's unabashed love of an art form, and tougher to fashion a 90 minute story out of it. The script treats the Cold War as backdrop, as if Castro and Kennedy are period tie-ins. There's a few coming-of-age subplots involving local teen boys and their romantic aspirations toward local teen girls, and these are well executed but ultimately shallow. "Mant," the film-within-a-film, is positioned broadly, as parody, which strikes me as a conceptual mistake. (If the filmmakers value schlock, then why present it as an unsophisticated joke? If they don't, then why make this film?) I want to like "Matinee" because it tries very hard to be a sweet natured look back at certain place and time. It happily references media I love. But watching, I smiled more than I laughed, and I spent most of the runtime thinking about other movies.
