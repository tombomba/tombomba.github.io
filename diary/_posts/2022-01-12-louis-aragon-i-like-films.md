> I like films without stupidity, the ones in which people kill each other and make love. I like films in which the characters are good-looking and have magnificent skin---you know, that can be seen close up. I like Mack Sennett comedies with women in bathing suits, German films with magnificent romantic scenes, the films made by my friend Delluc, in which there are people who desire each other for a whole hour until the people in the audience make their seats rattle. I like films in which there is blood. I like films in which there is no morality, in which vice is not punished, in which there is no fatherland or soldier boys, in which there is no Breton woman at the foot of an outdoor cross, _in which there is no philosophy or poetry. Poetry isn't something you look for, it's something you find..._

Aragon was a French poet who hung around with Andr√© Breton and who was both a surrealist and a communist. Delluc was a writer, critic, and filmmaker who wrote one of the first books on Charlie Chaplin. I wasn't familiar with either before I stumbled across this quote on socials. I don't know the source of it. I think it perfectly describes the movies, or the love of the movies, or what drives someone to the them. "Until the people in the audience make their seats rattle."

I put this page up and took it down. But I like the sound of Aragon, his rhythm, his use of language. I wanted to remember his words. So up again it goes.
