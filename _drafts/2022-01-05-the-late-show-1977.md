Who knew Art Carney had such range? (Well, the people who awarded him an Oscar, presumably, but...)

Good little pulp, and a plot straight from the magazines, with Carney playing a aged, burned out private detective and TKTK playing a New Hollywood flake (who never shuts the fuck up).

I liked how the investigation became more complex and convoluted as the story unrolled. Starts with the detective looking for a lady's cat until a couple of dudes show up and get dead on the front lawn.

Surprised me a couple of times because most of the cast is comprised of TV actors and the show has a TV movie feel (and a TV title) ...and yet there's a lot of violence and implied violence. Director TKTK isn't afraid to throw around plenty of squibs and let the blood drip on camera.

The show has an appropriately seedy, run down down feel and nobody except the bad guys has any money. (And the bad guys have the overbearing, sleazy personalities of discount electronics salesmen, always on the make and looking to make a "deal.")

A good ending that ties up everything in a satisfactory way, although some details are very late in coming. Early on, the story is tough to understand because the scripts constantly reference characters who are offscreen (and in some cases, never appear) and a crime that occurred before the movie's start. It's sort the "Big Sleep" Sean Regan problem.
