Gregory Peck wears a black hat in a western directed by William Wellman. A group of bank robbers cross the desert and discover an old man and a young girl living in a ghost town. The pair sit on an abandoned mining fortune and these thieves want a cut. Loyalties split early, as some of the men are more interested in the girl than the gold, and factions lines become narrower and narrower. Lotsa noir vibes, but not as try-hard as some others (the movie keeps the shadows but doesn't attempt the glib dialogue). "Yellow Sky" is littered with grimy characters who wouldn't be out of place in a Mann picture, and they're played by actors who take the material from B picture to B plus. Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark, John Russell, and Harry Morgan are the outlaws. Anne Baxter shines as the girl, bouncing a six gun on her hip and refusing to melt for anyone. Wellman shot on location, and there's some strong compositions among the high desert crags, with sound to match, as voices and gunfire reverberate off the rock with a hollow echo. Produced around the time of Ford's calvary trilogy and Hawk's "Red River," the movie looks cruder and cleaner, and plays nastier, as if it might have been made 10 or 20 years later.
