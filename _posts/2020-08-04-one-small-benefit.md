Mannequin Pussy, a band out of Philly, [says](https://twitter.com/mannequinpussy/status/1290438868307791873): it actually feels very freeing that there's no touring and therefore no livable income to be made from music (at least for a band of 4 people). like all the pressure is off to make music that will be 'successful'?? Idk it it makes sense but we started making music together because we loved it & when it became our full time jobs it felt incredible but also kicked in feelings of dread. We would talk about the future like there was a pressure to continue to prove ourselves? To get 'bigger' and now none of that shit matters"
