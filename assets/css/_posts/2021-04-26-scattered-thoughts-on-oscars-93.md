Decent given the limitations, but the production design made Union Station resemble a Vegas lounge, and the ceremony played like a weird combo of the Golden Globes and the MTV Movie Awards.

Opening credits on an award show are tacky. We're already in our seats. We know who you are. You don't need to hype us.

The Academy should have bowed to reality last summer, or at least nodded at it, and cancelled the ceremony. Instead they offered ghoulish self aggrandizement in the opening remarks. 3 million dead, but movies!

You'd think the producers would want consistency now more than ever. Like in the order of the awards. But no.

Fennell did a better job of directing "Promising Young Woman" than Zhao did with "Nomadland," but both wrote mediocre scripts.

Daniel Kaluuya was high, right?

Questlove is always good television. Point a camera at him, the man glows. He can make anything more fun than it has a right to be (like trivia games).

Glenn Close was funny in a too-obvious bit. But the more she laughed at the gag, the more I pitied her, because she was trying to be likeable in a room full of people who do not like her.

Some musical cues were Academy nominees from years past, some weren't. None made sense. Public Enemy's "Fight the Power" into Brad Pitt and Best Supporting Actress. Simple Minds' "Don't You Forget About Me" before Renée Zellweger. McCartney's "Live and Let Die" as Chloé Zhao left the stage.

Viola Davis in that white dress.

Tyler Perry is the Roger Corman of the 21st century. Highly skilled, highly successful impresario, the ringmaster of his own deliberate circus. He may never be back on that stage again, but it was nice to see some acknowledgement, whatever the context.

What I saw from this year was perfectly fine, mass market entertainment. None were Best Pictures.

People who won in major categories, per place of origin: U.S. (2x), England (2x), China, Denmark, Wales, Korea, Portugal, and France. If the Oscar is global, then let it be global. Abolish "Best International" and design a system that allows future noms to reflect a new reality.

Is Marlee Matlin Hollywood's one deaf friend?

That only 2 women have won Best Director in 93 years is embarrassing. That Zhao won for "Nomadland" is only slightly less embarrassing.

I imagine being around Frances McDormand is like being around the mom from "Almost Famous," but ceaselessly and without interruption. Years ago, she took the stage and talked about inclusion riders without knowing quite what they were. This year, she encouraged us to go back to the movies. Soon as. Right quick. Meanwhile, only a third of my country is vaxxed. Thanks, but no thanks.
