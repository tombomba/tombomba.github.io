Almost a proto-"Fistful of Dollars," with Randolph Scott playing 2 bandit groups off against one another in a small Arizona town. The movie doesn't take full advantage of its premise, though, and the script is muddled. Characters are lashed to the plot and the dialogue is perfunctory. Sometimes it feels as if there's half a reel missing as events and conversations are referenced but not depicted. There's some nice stylistic flourish on an obviously low budget, courtesy of director Andr√© de Toth, along with some good 3D cheese and technicolor pop. The action sequences, mostly horseback chasing stagecoach through ravines and gullies, have real zing to them. Claire Trevor stands out as a half-hearted love interest for Scott, portraying a woman whose inner life seems bigger and more interesting than this picture. Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin round out the cast, and both would soon appear in better movies (Borgnine in "From Here to Eternity" and "Jubal," Marvin in "Bad Day at Black Rock" and "7 Men from Now").
