Everyone on the internet is required to have an opinion about [the "French Dispatch" trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcPk2p0Zaw4) so here's mine:

It's an ad for the Wes Anderson movie.

I don't know what "The French Dispatch" is about and I still don't after viewing the clip. It doesn't matter. Anderson lives in his own cinematic universe, sole proprietor of an arthouse franchise. This new one will find the same audience and achieve the same success as the one before, and the one before that, and the one before that.

To watch this trailer is to experience familiar beats, gentle voiceovers, quirky characters, and obsessive design. Anderson can only continue inside the niche he made for himself twenty years ago. He has become both franchisor and franchisee of the Wes Anderson House Style. Almost a genre unto himself. Perfect repetition is now the goal, I think. It's what draws the crowd back.

Once Anderson defined himself with "Rushmore," there was no substantive change to the look and feel of his movies, to the why and how of his stories. This places him in an odd position: an auteur who is more craftsman than artist. His work exists in a sorta liminal space, remembered more for how it looked than what it said. There's little reason to debate the merits of one picture over another, to talk about choices in "Moonrise Kingdom" versus those in "Grand Budapest," and even his rabid followers must stretch to do it.

David Ehrlich, film critic and apparent stan, isn't wrong when he [says](https://twitter.com/davidehrlich/status/1227660182555123713), "Complaining that Wes Anderson has made another Wes Anderson movie is like being mad at a bagel for having a hole in the middle."

He's right. It's silly. Anderson's films are of a very specific piece. Either you embrace that or you don't.

But then I can't think of anything more boring than walking into a new movie and knowing exactly what I'm about to see.
